In all of Portland’s \nhistory, the city has had only two zoning codes, one adopted in 1924 and the other in \n1959. The 1959 code has served us well, but over time it has become outdated and \nburdened by amendments. The new code is the product of a major four-year effort. This \nproduct is the result of substantial work from the citizens of Portland, business groups, the \nPlanning Commission, the staff of the Bureau of Planning, and other agencies. During the \nprocess, the city Council, Planning Commission, and the Bureau of Planning held over \n150 public meetings and hearings to hear public comments and review the new zoning \ncode. Over 300 people testified before the Planning Commission and City Council and \nmany, many letters have been received and considered. The creation of this document has \ntruly been a public effort. \n \nThe new zoning code will result in a substantial improvement in the city’s land use \nregulations to serve us into the twenty-first century. The code will also improve the \nimplementation of the goals and policies of the city’s Comprehensive Plan. The document \nis shorter and easier to read and understand than the present code. The regulations address \nthe land use issues of today and prepare us for the growth of the future. The goal of \nproviding certainty in regulations is balanced with the benefits of flexibility. \n \nThe improvements contained tin the new zoning code represent a positive step forward in \nland use regulation and growth management in Portland. The code will be a major factor \nin shaping the future vision and direction for our city. On behalf of the entire City \nCouncil, I wish to thank all the citizens in Portland who have worked so hard and given \nso much to develop this document. \n \nSincerely, \n \nEarl Blumenauer \nCommissioner of Public Works \n   \n \n  6/1/25 \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning \nList of Chapters \n \nIntroduction \nHow to Use This Document \n10 Legal Framework and Relationships \n \n \nBase

The zoning code is organized as a reference document. It is not intended to be read \nfrom cover to cover. Instead, it is organized so you may look up only the parts you need. The list of \nchapters in the table of contents is, therefore, very important, as are the section listings at the \nbeginning of each chapter. Later portions of this introduction explain two different methods to use \nthe code for commonly asked questions. There are many other ways to use this code, depending on \nyour objectives. \nChapters that cover related information have been grouped together. There are nine groups, or \nseries of chapters. The first series, called the Introduction, contains some basic information on the \nlegal framework of the code and this guide on how to use the code. The eight remaining series are \nsummarized below. \nThis code is used in conjunction with other City Titles; many service and technical requirements are \ncontained in other Titles. \nThe Base Zones (100 series). The 100 series contains the base zone chapters. These chapters state \nwhich uses are allowed in each zone. They also state which uses are allowed in limited situations, \nwhich are conditional uses, and which are prohibited. The general development standards for each \nbase zone are also included. The development standards include requirements such as maximum \nheights and required setbacks. \nAdditional Use and Development Regulations (200 series). The 200 series contains regulations for \nspecific uses and development types that apply in many base zones. The chapters in this series also \nstate the development standards that apply across many zones such as the parking and landscaping \nregulations. This grouping provides consolidated information and less repetition in code language. \nThere are references in the base zones to the requirements in the 200 series, when applicable. The \nregulations in the 200s generally supplement the regulations in the base zones. \nOverlay Zones (400 series) and Plan Districts (500 series). Overlay zones consist of regulations that \naddress specific subjects that may be applicable in a variety of areas in the City. Plan districts consist \nof regulations that have been tailored to a specific area of the City. Both overlay zones and plan \ndistricts are applied in conjunction with a base zone and modify the regulations of the base zone. \nThe Official Zoning Maps identify overlay zones and plan districts as well as the base zones and other \ninformation. \nLand Divisions and Planned Developments (600 series). The 600 series contains the regulations for \ndividing and reconfiguring land. Within this series are four groups of chapters: \nChapters 33.605 through 33.615 address lot dimensions for all zones, and density for the single-\ndwelling zones and for the multi-dwelling zones when single-dwelling development is proposed. \nChapters 33.630 through 33.641 contain special regulations for lands subject to flood or landslide; \nthe regulations for tree preservation, clearing and grading, phased plans and staged Final Plats, \nrequired recreation area, seeps and springs, transportation impacts, and tracts and easements.  How to Use This Document Title 33, Planning and Zoning \n 10/1/24 \n \nii \nChapters 33.651 through 33.654 are the regulations for services and utilities. These chapters are \nintended to tie together all of the requirements for services and utilities, many of which are found in \nother City Titles, manuals, and guides. \nChapters 33.660 through 33.673 include the information on reviews of each phase of a Land \nDivision, including the procedure types and approval criteria. Chapter 33.668 contains the \nregulations for amending an approved PUD. Chapters 33.675 through 33.677 include the regulations \nfor reconfiguring properties and confirming lots. \nAdministration and Procedures (700 series). The 700 series provides information on the City's \nadministrative framework and procedures that relate to land use. Information on application \nrequirements, staff-level processing, review bodies, public hearings, and appeals is included along \nwith other provisions on administering the zoning code. \nLand Use Reviews (800 series). The 800 series describes most of the various land use reviews. Some \nreviews may be applied for at the discretion of the applicant, such as a conditional use or \nadjustment request. Other reviews are mandatory in certain situations such as design review. The \n800 series contains the thresholds that state when a review is required, and the approval criteria for \nthe land use review. \nGeneral Terms (900 series). The 900 series contains the description of the use categories, which \ninclude all the uses regulated by the zoning code. The series also contains the definitions chapter \nand a chapter on methods of measurement. \nReserved Series (300s). The 300 series of chapters has been reserved for future amendments or \nadditions to Title 33. \nDetermining the Zoning Regulations for a Specific Site \nTo determine the zoning regulations applicable to a site, you must first find the site on the Official \nZoning Maps. The appropriate map will show the base zone that is applied to the site. It will also \nshow if the site is subject to any overlay zones or plan districts, and if the site contains a historical \nlandmark or recreational trail. You then look up all the corresponding regulations. Start with the \nbase zones (the 100 series of chapters). The base zones state whether a use is allowed by right, \nallowed with limitations, a conditional use, or prohibited. The base zones also contain most of the \ndevelopment standards that apply to the uses that are allowed or limited. The base zones will \nindicate if certain reviews are necessary, such as conditional use review. In these cases look up the \nappropriate chapter.  \nSome uses and types of development have specific regulations stated in the 200 series of chapters. \nAlthough such instances are referenced in the base zones, it is a good idea to check over the 200 \nseries to confirm if any of the chapters apply to your situation. Next, look up any overlay zones or \nplan districts that may apply to your site. These are listed in the 400 and 500 series of chapters. \nFinally, if the Official Zoning Maps indicate that the site has a historic landmark or recreational trail \ndesignation, look up those chapters for the corresponding regulations. \nChapters 33.910, Definitions and 33.930, Measurements may be helpful in understanding how to \napply the regulations to a specific site.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  How to Use This Document \n10/1/24 \n \niii \nDetermining Where a Specific Use May Locate \nTo determine in what zones a specific use may be located, you must first determine what land use \ncategory it is in. Use Chapter 33.920, Descriptions of the Use Categories, to classify the specific use. \nThen look at the primary use tables in the base zone chapters to see the status of that category. \nCategories are either allowed, allowed with special limitations, may be allowed through a \nconditional use review, or are prohibited. You should also check the list of the 200s chapters, \nbecause some uses are subject to additional regulations. Finally, although a base zone might allow a \nuse, a specific site may be subject to additional regulations from an overlay zone or plan district. The \nregulations of the overlay zone or plan district supersede the regulations of the base zone and may \naffect the status of the use, so those regulations should be considered. \nDetermining the Land Division Regulations for a Specific Site \nTo determine the Land Division regulations applicable to a site, you must first find the site on the \nOfficial Zoning Maps. The appropriate map will show the base zone that is applied to the site. This \nwill tell you which chapters to look at in this Title; the 100s and 600s are organized by zone. The \nZoning Map will also show if the site is subject to any overlay zones or plan districts, and if the site \ncontains a historical landmark or major public trail. You then look up all the corresponding \nregulations. All of these regulations will tell you what uses are allowed, what housing types may be \nconsidered, and what development regulations affect your site. Some of these development \nregulations will help you determine how to design your Land Division. \nIn the 600 series of chapters, you should first look in Chapters 33.605 through 33.615 for the zone of \nyour site; these chapters contain the regulations on lot density and lot dimensions. Then review \nChapters 33.630 through 33.641: Chapters 33.630, Tree Preservation, 33.635, Clearing, Grading, and \nLand Suitability, 33.636, Tracts and Easements, and 33.640, Streams, Springs, Seeps, and Wetlands \napply to all Land Divisions. Chapters 33.631 and 33.632 apply only to sites that may be subject to \nflood or landslide; City maps can help you determine if your land may be subject to these hazards. \nChapters 33.633, Phased Land Divisions and Staged Final Plats apply to proposals that include those \nelements, while Chapter 33.634 only applies to sites where a recreation area is required. A \ntransportation impact study may be required as per 33.641. Chapter 33.642, Land Divisions of \nManufactured Dwelling Parks and Chapter 33.644, Middle Housing Land Divisions contain \nregulations for these alternative types of development. \nChapters 33.651 through 33.654 contain the regulations for services that apply to land divisions. \nFinally, Chapters 33.660 through 33.677 will tell you what reviews are needed for your Land Division \nProperty Line Adjustment, Replat, or Lot Confirmation, and what standards and approval criteria \nmust be met for your request to be approved. \nChapters 33.910, Definitions and 33.930, Measurements may be helpful in understanding how to \napply the land division regulations to a specific site.  How to Use This Document Title 33, Planning and Zoning \n 10/1/24 \n \niv \nFormat of Title 33 \nOutline. The format of Title 33 follows the layout of all revised Titles in the City Code. The chapter \nand section numbers use an expandable decimal numbering system adopted by the City in 1969. \nMajor divisions within the Title are called chapters. Major divisions within chapters are called \nsections. The format of the divisions in the Title are shown below. \n \n \n33.xxx Chapter Title \nXXX \n \nSections: \n33.xxx.yyy \n33.XXX.XXX Section \nA. Subsection \n1. Paragraph \na. Subparagraph \n(1) Subsubparagraph \n \nReferencing Within Title 33. References within Title 33 are made as follows: \nOutside of the same section. When a reference is to text outside of the same section, the reference \nnumber starts with the Title number (i.e. 33), and continues to the appropriate level for the \nreference. For example, 33.110.050.B. refers to Subsection B. of Section 050, of Chapter 110, of Title \n33. The names \"Title\" and \"Chapter\" are used if the reference is to an entire Title or Chapter. \nWithin the same section. When a reference is to text within the same section, the name of the \ndivision level is used (i.e. Subsection, Paragraph, Subparagraph, etc.), and the reference \"number\" \nstarts with the appropriate subsection letter. For example, \"See Paragraph D.2., below\" refers to \nParagraph 2., of Subsection D., of the same section. \nReferencing Other Documents. When a reference is to a document outside of the Portland City \nCode, the referenced document’s name is in italicized text, such as Balch Creek Watershed \nProtection Plan. \nTerms \nThe code has been written in a \"plain English\" style and the meaning is intended to be clear as read. \nHowever, because it is also a legal document and because of the need for terms with specific \nmeanings, the code also provides guidance on how specific terms are used. Chapter 33.910, \nDefinitions, defines words that have a specific meaning in this code. 33.700.070, General Rules for \nApplication of the Code Language, contains other information on how terms are used in this code.

All land and water. The zoning code applies to all land and water within the City of \nPortland except as provided in Subsections B., C., and D. below. All land divisions, uses and \ndevelopment must comply with all of the requirements specified in the zoning code for \nthat location. \nB. Clarification for rights-of-way. Land within private rights-of-way, including rail rights-of-\nway and utility rights-of-way, is regulated by Title 33. Land within public rights-of-way is \nregulated by Title 17, Public Improvements, and not by Title 33, except in the following \nsituations where both Titles apply: \n1. The act of creating or dedicating public rights-of-way through a land division; \n2. Structures that project from private property over rights-of way, such as oriel \nwindows; \n3. Proposals for park-and-ride facilities for mass transit; \n4. Development within rights-of-way in the design, historic resource, greenway, river, \nenvironmental conservation, environmental protection, pleasant valley natural \nresource, and scenic resource overlay zones, including the creation of new rights-of-\nway and the expansion of existing rights-of-way. In this situation, the regulations and \nstandards of the base zones, plan districts and 200 series of chapters do not apply. \nC. Clarification for waterbodies. The siting of fills or structures on or over waterbodies is \nsubject to the zoning code provisions. The zoning code does not regulate shipping, \ndredging, boating, and other similar uses on or in water bodies. The zoning code does \nregulate dredging in the Willamette River Central and South reaches and the Greenway  Chapter 33.10 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nLegal Framework and Relationships 1/1/25 \n \n10-2 \noverlay zone in the South Waterfront Subdistrict of the Central City but does not regulate \ndredging on or in any other portion of the Willamette River or any other water body. \nD. Private rights-of-way. The creation of private rights-of-way is regulated by Title 33, \nPlanning and Zoning. Street improvements in private rights-of-way are allowed by right in \nall zones. \n33.10.040 Other City, Regional, State, and Federal Regulations \nA. Compliance required. In addition to the requirements of the zoning code, all uses and \ndevelopment must comply with all other applicable City, regional, state, and  \nfederal regulations. \nB. References to other regulations. All references in the zoning code to other City, regional, \nstate, or federal regulations are for informational purposes only, and do not constitute a \ncomplete list of such regulations. These references do not imply any responsibility by the \nCity for enforcement of regional, state, or federal regulations. \nC. Current versions and citations. All references to other City, regional, state, or federal \nregulations in the zoning code refer to the most current version and citation for those \nregulations, unless specifically indicated otherwise. Where the referenced regulations have \nbeen repealed, zoning code requirements for compliance are no longer in effect. \n33.10.050 Official Zoning Maps \nA. Content of Official Zoning Maps. The boundaries of the base zones, overlay zones, and \nplan districts are shown on the Official Zoning Maps of the City of Portland. The maps also \nshow the location of historical landmarks, and existing and planned major public trails. The \nOfficial Zoning Maps are a part of the zoning code, but are published separately. Maps that \ndelineate areas subject to additional zoning regulations may be included in the zoning \ncode, attached to the adopting ordinance, or adopted by reference. The Bureau of Planning \nand Sustainability maintains the Official Zoning Maps.  \nB. Changes to Official Zoning Maps. A proposed change to the Official Zoning maps is subject \nto the amendment process described in Chapter 33.855, Zoning Map Amendments. \nC. Boundary lines.  \n1. Where a zoning line is shown on the Official Zoning Maps as being within an existing \nor vacated right-of-way, utility corridor, railroad line, or a water course, the line is in \nthe center unless specifically indicated otherwise. \n2. The location of a zoning line is determined with a scale when a zoning line does not \nfollow a lot line or identifiable landmark and its location is not specifically indicated. \n33.10.060 Comprehensive Plan Designations \nA. Mapping format. The Official Zoning Maps also show the Comprehensive Plan \ndesignations. Where the zoning map symbol is a corresponding zone of the Comprehensive \nPlan designation, only the zoning map symbol is shown for an area. Where the zoning map \nsymbol is a less intense zone than the Comprehensive Plan designation, the area of the \ndiffering Comprehensive Plan designation is outlined with a dotted line and the \nComprehensive Plan designation is shown in parentheses.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.10 \n1/1/25 Legal Framework and Relationships \n \n10-3 \nB. Map symbols. Where there is only one corresponding zone for a Comprehensive Plan \ndesignation, the map symbol for the designation is the same symbol as for the \ncorresponding zone. Where there is more than one corresponding zone for a \nComprehensive Plan designation, the map symbols are as follows: \n \nComprehensive Plan Designation Map Symbol \nMixed Use – Urban Center MU – U \nMixed Use – Civic Corridor MU – C \nMixed Use – Neighborhood MU – N \nMixed Use – Dispersed  MU – D \nInstitutional Campus CI \nMixed Employment ME \nIndustrial Sanctuary IS \n33.10.070 Severability \nIf any portion of the zoning code is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent \njurisdiction, that portion is to be deemed severed from the zoning code, and in no way affects the \nvalidity of the remainder of the zoning code. \n \n(Amended by: Ord.

The zones implement the comprehensive plan policies and  Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  10/1/24 \n110-2 \ndesignations for single-dwelling housing and provide options for infill housing that is compatible \nwith the scale of the single-dwelling neighborhood.  \nA. Use regulations. The use regulations are intended to create, maintain and promote single-\ndwelling neighborhoods. They allow for some non-household living uses but not to such an \nextent as to sacrifice the overall image and character of the single-dwelling neighborhood.  \nB. Development standards. The development standards preserve the character of \nneighborhoods by providing six different zones with different densities and development \nstandards. The development standards work together to promote desirable residential \nareas by addressing aesthetically pleasing environments, safety, privacy, energy \nconservation, and recreational opportunities. The site development standards allow for \nflexibility of development while maintaining compatibility within the City's various \nneighborhoods. In addition, the regulations provide certainty to property owners, \ndevelopers, and neighbors about the limits of what is allowed. The development standards \nare generally written for houses on flat, regularly shaped lots. Other situations are \naddressed through special regulations or exceptions. \n33.110.020 List of the Single-Dwelling Zones  \nThe full names, short names, and map symbols of the single-dwelling residential zones are listed \nbelow. When this Title refers to the single-dwelling zones, it is referring to the six zones listed here. \nWhen this Title refers to the residential zones, or R zones, it is referring to both the single-dwelling \nzones in this chapter and the multi-dwelling zones in Chapter 33.120.

Purpose. Housing types are limited in the single-dwelling zones to maintain the overall \nimage and character of the City's single-dwelling neighborhoods. However, the regulations \nallow options to increase housing variety and opportunities, and to promote affordable and \nenergy-efficient housing. \nB. Housing types. The kinds of housing types allowed in the single-dwelling zones are stated \nin Table 110-2. \n \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.110 \n1/1/25  Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n110-7 \nTable 110-2 \nHousing Types Allowed In The Single-Dwelling Zones  \nHousing Type RF R20 R10 R7 R5 R2.5 \nHouse \n \nYes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nAttached house  \n(See 33.110.260.C and \n33.110.265.C) \n \nNo \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \nAccessory dwelling unit \n(See Chapter 33.205) \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \nDuplex No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nTriplex \n(See 33.110.265.E) \nNo \n \nYes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nFourplex \n(See 33.110.265.E) \nNo Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nMulti-dwelling Structure \n(See 33.110.265.F) \nNo Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nCottage Cluster  \n(See 33.110.265.G) \nNo No Yes Yes Yes Yes \nManufactured home \n(See Chapter 33.251) \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \nManufactured Dwelling \npark \nNo No No No No No \nHouseboat \n(See Chapter 33.236) \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \nCongregate Housing \nFacility (See \n33.110.100.B.1) \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \n \nYes \nAttached Duplex Only in Planned Developments, See Chapter 33.270. \nMulti-dwelling \nDevelopment \nOnly in Planned Developments, See Chapter 33.270. \nYes = allowed; No = prohibited. \n \n33.110.202 When Primary Structures are Allowed \nA. Purpose. The regulations of this section allow for development of primary structures on \nlots and lots of record that are an adequate size, but do not legitimize plots that were \ndivided after subdivision and partitioning regulations were established. The regulations \nensure that development on a site will in most cases be able to comply with all site \ndevelopment standards. The regulations also allow development of primary structures on \nlots that were large enough in the past, but were reduced by condemnation or required \ndedications for right-of-way. \nB. Adjustments. Except as allowed by C.4.a and C.5, adjustments to this section are \nprohibited. \nC. Primary structures allowed. Development of a primary structure is allowed as follows: \n1. On a lot created on or after July 26, 1979;  Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  1/1/25 \n110-8 \n2. On a lot created through the Planned Development or Planned Unit  \nDevelopment process; \n3. On a lot, lot of record, lot remnant, or combinations thereof that did not abut a lot, lot \nof record, or lot remnant under the same ownership on July 26, 1979, and has not \nabutted a lot, lot of record, or lot remnant under the same ownership since July 26, \n1979; \n4. On a lot or adjusted lot or combination thereof that either:  \na. Meets the minimum lot size requirements stated in Table 110-3. Until January 2, \n2032, adjustments to reduce the minimum lot size requirements by up to 10 \npercent may be requested. Beginning January 2, 2032, adjustments are \nprohibited; or  \nb.  Does not meet the minimum lot size requirements stated in Table 110-3 but \nmeets all of the following: \n(1) No portion of the lot, adjusted lot or combination is in an Environmental, \nRiver Environmental, or Pleasant Valley Natural Resources overlay zone; \n(2) No portion of the lot, adjusted lot or combination is in the combined flood \nhazard area; and \n(3) The lot, adjusted lot or combination has an average slope of less than 25 \npercent. \n5. On a lot of record or lot remnant or combination thereof that meets the minimum lot \nsize requirements of Table 110-3. Until January 2, 2032, adjustments to reduce the \nminimum lot size requirements by up to 10 percent may be requested. Beginning \nJanuary 2, 2032, adjustments are prohibited. \nD. Plots. Development is prohibited on plots that are not lots, adjusted lots, lots of record, lot \nremnants, or tracts. \n \nTable 110-3 \nMinimum Lot Size Requirements  \nRF through R5 Zones \nLot 36 feet wide and \nmeets the minimum lot area requirement for all \nother lots stated in \nTable 610-2.

[1, 4] \nAdjusted Lot \nLot Remnants  \nLots of Record  \nNotes: \n[1] A primary structure is allowed on a lot or lot of record that did meet the requirements of Table \n110-3 in the past but was reduced below the requirements solely because of condemnation or \nrequired dedication by a public agency for right-of-way.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.110 \n1/1/25  Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n110-9 \n[2] In the R5 zone, the minimum size requirements for adjusted lots and lot remnants approved \nthrough a property line adjustment under 33.677.300.A.4. or 33.677.300.C. are 36 ft. wide and 1,600 \nsq. ft.  \n[3] In the R20 zone, a primary structure is allowed on a lot, lot of record, adjusted lot, lot remnant, or \ncombination thereof that did meet the requirements of Table 110-3 in the past but no longer meets \nthe requirements solely due to a zone change effective on May 24, 2018.   \n[4] A primary structure is allowed on a lot, lot of record, adjusted lot, lot remnant, or combination \nthereof that was separated from abutting lots through a lot confirmation that was finalized before \nSeptember 11, 2020.  \n[5] Lot width for a flag lot is measured at the midpoint of the flag portion of the lot.  \n33.110.205 Minimum Dwelling Unit Density  \nA. Purpose. This standard promotes additional housing opportunities in areas of the city \nwhere services are available and restricts larger sites from being utilized for a single house.  \nB. When this standard applies. The minimum dwelling unit density standard applies to new \ndevelopment when at least one dwelling unit is proposed. Sites in the Constrained Sites \noverlay zone are exempt from this standard. \nC. Minimum dwelling unit density.  \n1. R7. In the R7 zone, a minimum of two dwelling units are required on sites that are \n14,000 square feet or larger in total site area.  \n2. R5. In the R5 zone, a minimum of two dwelling units are required on sites that are \n10,000 square feet or larger in total site area.  \n3.  R2.5. In the R2.5 zone, a minimum of two dwelling units are required on sites that are \n5,000 square feet or larger in total site area.

Floor area ratios (FAR) work with height, setback, and building coverage \nrequirements to control the overall bulk and placement of buildings. The maximum FAR \nallowances have been calibrated by zone to: \n• Define the character of each zone by establishing greater FAR allowances in the higher \nintensity zones;  \n• Encourage the provision of additional dwelling units within existing neighborhoods by \nrelating the allowed amount of FAR to the total number of units on a site; and \n• Ensure that the bulk of buildings on one lot does not overwhelm development on \nadjacent lots.  \nB. Maximum FAR. Maximum floor area ratios are stated in Table 110-4. Maximum FAR \napplies to all buildings on the lot, however the maximum allowed is based on the total \nnumber of dwelling units on the lot and whether a bonus option is chosen. In the R10 and \nR20 zones, the maximum FAR only applies to lots that are less than 10,000 square feet in \narea. The maximum FAR for a lot with a congregate housing facility is the same as shown in \nTable 110-4 for a lot with 1 total dwelling unit. The maximum FAR for institutional uses is \nstated in 33.110.270. Adjustments to the maximum FAR ratios, including bonus ratios, are \nprohibited. \nC. Exceptions.  \n1. Maximum FAR does not apply to one alteration or addition of up to 250 square feet \nwhen the alteration or addition is to a primary structure that received final inspection \nat least 5 years ago. This exception is allowed once every 5 years. \n2. Stairwells are only counted as floor area on one level.  \nD. Maximum FAR with bonus. \n1. Affordable housing bonus option. The maximum FAR for lots that provide at least one \ndwelling unit that is affordable to those earning no more than 60 percent of the area \nmedian family income or an affordability level established by Title 30 is stated in Table \n110-4. To qualify for this maximum FAR with bonus: \na. The applicant must provide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying \nthat the development meets the affordability standard stated above. The letter is \nrequired to be submitted before a building permit can be issued but is not \nrequired in order to apply for a land use review; and  \nb. The property owner must execute a covenant with the City that complies with \nthe requirements of 33.700.060. The covenant must ensure that the affordable \ndwelling unit will remain affordable to households meeting the income \nrestriction and any administrative requirements of the Portland Housing Bureau.  \n2. Preserving existing dwelling units bonus option. The maximum FAR for lots that \ncontain a primary residential structure that received final inspection at least 5 years \nago is stated in Table 110-4. To qualify for this maximum FAR with bonus, an \nadditional dwelling unit must be added to the site, and no more than 25 percent of  Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  1/1/25 \n110-12 \nthe existing street-facing façade of the existing primary residential structure may be \naltered to add additional floor area.   \n33.110.215 Height \nA.  Purpose. The height standards serve several purposes: \n• They foster a reasonable building scale and relationship of one residence to another; \n• They promote options for privacy for neighboring properties; and \n• They reflect the general building scale and placement of houses in the  \ncity's single-dwelling neighborhoods. \nB.  Maximum height. The maximum height allowed is stated in Table 110-4. The maximum \nheight standards for detached and connected accessory structures are stated in \n33.110.245, Detached and Connected Accessory Structures. The maximum height standard \nfor narrow lots is stated in 33.110.260, Additional Development Standards for Narrow Lots. \nThe maximum height standard for small flag lots is stated in 33.110.255, Additional \nStandards for Flag Lots. The maximum height standard for institutional uses is stated in \n33.110.270, Institutional Development Standards. \nC. Exceptions to the maximum height. \n1. Chimneys, vents, flag poles, satellite receiving dishes and other similar items with a \nwidth, depth, or diameter of 3 feet or less may extend above the height limit, as long \nas they are attached to a building and do not exceed 5 feet above the top of the \nhighest point of the roof. If they are greater than 3 feet in width, depth, or diameter, \nthey are subject to the height limit. \n2. Dormers are not included in the height calculation when:  \na. The roof of the dormer has a pitch of at least 3 in 12 and no part of the dormer \nextends above the ridgeline of the roof; \nb. The walls of the dormer are set back at least 12 inches from the plane of any \nexterior wall of the floor below; and \nc. The width of the dormer is not more than 75 percent of the width of the roof \nfrom which it projects. See Figure 110-1 \n3. Farm buildings associated with an agricultural use, such as silos and barns are exempt \nfrom the height limit as long as they are set back from all lot lines, at least one foot for \nevery foot in height. \n4. Antennas, utility power poles, and public safety facilities are exempt from the  \nheight limit. \n5. Small wind turbines are subject to the standards of Chapter 33.299, Wind Turbines. \n6. Roof mounted solar panels are not included in height calculations, and may exceed \nthe maximum height limit as follows: \na. For flat roofs or the horizontal portion of mansard roofs, the roof mounted solar \npanel may extend up to 5 feet above the top of the highest point of the roof.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.110 \n1/1/25  Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n110-13 \nb. For pitched, hipped or gambrel roofs, the roof mounted solar panel must be \nmounted no more than 12 inches from the surface of the roof at any point, and \nmay not extend above the ridgeline of the roof. The 12 inches is measured from \nthe upper side of the solar panel. \nFigure 110-1 \nDormers \n \nD. Alternative height limits for steeply sloping lots. \n1. Downhill slope from street. On lots that slope downhill from the street with an \naverage slope of 20 percent or greater, the height limit is the higher of either 23 feet \nabove the average of the grade of the street or the normal height limit calculated as \nstated in Chapter 33.930, Measurements. In addition, the alternative height and \nsetback standards of Subsection 33.110.220.D apply. For the purpose of this \nparagraph, the average grade of the street is measured at the street lot line property \ncorners. \n2. Uphill slope from the street. On lots that slope uphill from the street with an average \nslope of 20 percent or greater the alternative height and setback standards of \nSubsection 33.110.220.D apply. \n3. Downhill and uphill slope from the street. On lots that slope uphill from one street and \ndownhill from another street with an average slope of 20 percent or greater, the \napplicant may meet the alternative height limit of Paragraph D.1. \n33.110.220 Setbacks \nA. Purpose. The setback regulations for buildings and garage entrances serve several \npurposes: \n• They maintain light, air, separation for fire protection, and access for fire fighting; \n• They reflect the general building scale and placement of residences in the city's single-\ndwelling neighborhoods; \n• They foster a reasonable physical relationship between residences; \n• They promote options for privacy for neighboring properties;  Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  1/1/25 \n110-14 \n• They require larger front setbacks than side and rear setbacks to promote open, \nvisually pleasing front yards;  \n• They provide adequate flexibility to site a building so that it may be compatible with \nthe neighborhood, fit the topography of the site, allow for required outdoor areas, and \nallow for architectural diversity; and  \n• They provide room for a car to park in front of a garage door without overhanging the \nstreet or sidewalk, and they enhance driver visibility when backing onto the street.  \nB. Required setbacks. The required setbacks for buildings and garage entrances are stated in \nTable 110-4. The walls of the garage structure are subject to the front, side, and rear \nbuilding setbacks stated in Table 110-4. The minimum setbacks for institutional uses are \nstated in 33.110.270, Institutional Development Standards. Other setbacks may apply to \nspecific types of development or situations.  \nC. Extensions into required building setbacks.  \n1. The following features of a building may extend into a required building setback up to \n20 percent of the depth of the setback. However, the feature must be at least three \nfeet from a lot line:  \na. Chimneys, fireplace inserts and vents, mechanical equipment, and fire escapes; \nb. Water collection cisterns and stormwater planters that do not meet the standard \nof Paragraph C.3; \nc. Decks, stairways, wheelchair ramps and uncovered balconies that do not meet \nthe standards of Paragraph C.3; and \nd. Bays and bay windows that meet the following requirements: \n(1) Each bay and bay window may be up to 12 feet long, but the total area of all \nbays and bay windows on a building facade cannot be more than 30 percent \nof the area of the facade; \n(2) At least 30 percent of the area of each bay which faces the property line \nrequiring the setback must be glazing or glass block; and  \n(3) Bays and bay windows must cantilever beyond the foundation of the \nbuilding.  \n2. Building eaves may extend up to 2 feet into a required building setback provided the \neave is at least three feet from a lot line. \n3. The following minor features of a building may extend into the entire required \nbuilding setbacks: \na. Utility connections attached to the building that are required to provide services \nsuch as water, electricity, and other similar utility services; \nb. Gutters and downspouts that drain stormwater off a roof of the structure; \nc. Stormwater planters that are no more than 2-1/2 feet above the ground; \nd. Water collection cisterns that are 6 feet or less in height;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.110 \n1/1/25  Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n110-15 \ne. D ecks, stairs and ramps that are no more than 2-1/2 feet above the ground. \nHowever, stairways and wheelchair ramps that lead to one entrance on the \nstreet-facing façade of a building are allowed to extend into the required setback \nfrom a street lot line regardless of height above ground; and \nf. On lots that slope down from the street, vehicular or pedestrian entry bridges \nthat are no more than 2-1/2 feet above the average sidewalk elevation. \n4. Detached accessory structures. The setback standards for detached accessory \nstructures, including detached mechanical equipment, are stated in 33.110.245. \nFences are addressed in 33.110.275. Detached accessory dwelling units are addressed \nin Chapter 33.205.  \nD. Exceptions to the required setbacks. \n1. Setback averaging. The front building setback, and the setback of decks, balconies, \nand porches may be reduced to the average of the respective setbacks on the abutting \nlots. See Chapter 33.930, Measurements, for more information. \n2. Flag lots. The lot in front of a flag lot may reduce its side building setback along the \nflag pole lot line to zero. All other setback requirements remain the same. \n3. Environmental zone. The front building and garage entrance setback may be reduced \nto zero where any portion of the site is in an environmental overlay zone. Where a \nside lot line is also a street lot line the side building and garage entrance setback may \nbe reduced to zero. All other provisions of this Title apply to the building and garage \nentrance.  \n4. Steeply sloping lots. This provision applies to lots that slope up or down from the \nstreet with an average slope of 20 percent or greater. See Chapter 33.930, \nMeasurements, for more information on how to measure average slope. \na. In the RF, R20, R10, and R7 zones, the front building setback for the dwelling may \nbe reduced to 10 feet. However, the height limitations of subparagraph c. apply. \nSee Figures 110-2 and 110-3. \nb. In all single-dwelling residential zones, the front building setback for the garage \nwall and/or the garage entrance setback may be reduced to five feet. However, \nthe height limitations of Paragraph D.4.c. apply. See Figures 110-2 and 110-3. \nc. Height limitation. The height limit in the area of the reduced setback is lowered \none foot for every foot of reduced setback. See Figures 110-2 and 110-3. \n5. Established building lines. The front, side, or rear building setback for the primary \nstructure may be reduced for sites with existing nonconforming development in a \nrequired setback. The reduction is allowed if the width of the portion of the existing \nwall of the primary structure within the required setback is at least 60 percent of the \nwidth of the respective facade of the existing primary structure. The building line \ncreated by the nonconforming wall serves as the reduced setback line. Eaves \nassociated with the nonconforming wall may extend the same distance into the \nreduced setback as the existing eave. However, side or rear setbacks may not be \nreduced to less than 3 feet in depth and eaves may not project closer than 2 feet to  Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  1/1/25 \n110-16 \nthe side or rear property line. See Figure 110-4. This reduced setback applies to \nalterations that are no higher than the existing nonconforming wall. For example, a \nsecond story could not be placed up to the reduced setback line if the existing \nnonconforming wall is only one story high.  \n6. Split zoning. No setbacks are required from an internal lot line that is also a zoning line \non sites with split zoning. \n7. Land divisions and Planned Developments with existing development. The following \nsetback reductions are allowed when proposed as part of a land division or Planned \nDevelopment: \na. The minimum setback between an existing building and a side lot line along a \nproposed right-of-way dedication or street tract may be reduced to three feet; \nb. When a dedication of public right-of-way along the frontage of an existing street \nis required as part of a land division or Planned Development, the minimum front \nor side setback between an existing building and a lot line that abuts the right-of-\nway may be reduced to zero. Future additions or development must meet \nrequired minimum setbacks.  \nc. Eaves on an existing building may extend one foot into the reduced setback \nallowed by D.7.a. or b., except they may not extend into the right-of-way.  \n8. Required dedication. When a dedication of public right-of-way along the frontage of \nan existing street is required by a public agency, the minimum front or side setback \nbetween an existing building and a lot line that abuts the right-of-way may be reduced \nto zero. Future additions or development must meet required minimum setbacks. \nEaves on an existing building may extend one foot into the reduced setback except \nthey may not extend into the right-of-way. \n9. Alley. No side, rear, or garage entrance setback is required from a lot line abutting an \nalley.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.110 \n1/1/25  Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n110-17 \nFigure 110-2 \nExceptions To Front Building Setback And Garage Entrance Setback—Downhill \n \nFigure 110-3 \nExceptions To Front Building Setback And Garage Entrance Setback—Uphill \n \n  Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  1/1/25 \n110-18 \nFigure 110-4 \nEstablished Building Lines \n \n \n33.110.225 Building Coverage \nA. Purpose. The building coverage standards limit the footprint of buildings and work \ntogether with the height, setback, and floor area ratio standards to control the overall bulk \nof structures. They are intended to ensure that taller buildings will not have such a large \nfootprint that their total bulk will overwhelm adjacent houses. Additionally, the standards \nhelp define the character of the different zones by limiting the amount of buildings allowed \non a site.  \nB. Building coverage standards. The maximum combined building coverage allowed on a site \nfor all covered structures is stated in Table 110-5.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.110 \n1/1/25  Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n110-19 \n \nTable 110-5 \nMaximum Building Coverage Allowed in the RF through R2.5 Zones \nLot Size  Maximum Building Coverage \nLess than 3,000 sq. ft.  50% of lot area \n3,000 sq. ft or more but less than 5,000 sq. ft.  1,500 sq. ft. + 37.5% of lot area over 3,000 sq. ft.  \n5,000 sq. ft. or more but less than 20,000 sq. ft.  2,250 sq. ft + 15% of lot area over 5,000 sq. ft. \n20,000 sq. ft. or more 4,500 sq. ft. + 7.5% of lot area over 20,000 sq. ft. \n33.110.227 Trees  \nRequirements for street trees and for on-site tree preservation, protection, and overall tree density \nare specified in Title 11, Trees. See Chapter 11.50, Trees in Development Situations. \n33.110.230 Main Entrances \nA. Purpose. These standards: \n• Work with the street-facing facade and garage standards to ensure that there is a \nphysical and visual connection between the living area of the residence and the street;  \n• Enhance public safety for residents and visitors and provide opportunities for \ncommunity interaction;  \n• Ensure that the pedestrian entrance is visible or clearly identifiable from the street by \nits orientation or articulation; and \n• Ensure a connection to the public realm for development on lots fronting both private \nand public streets by making the pedestrian entrance visible or clearly identifiable from \nthe public street. \nB. Where these standards apply.  \n1.  The standards of this section apply to all residential structure types in the R10 through \nR2.5 zones except accessory dwelling units;  \n2.  Where a proposal is for an alteration or addition to existing development, the \nstandards of this section apply only to the portion being altered or added;  \n3.  On sites with frontage on both a private street and a public street, the standards apply \nto the site frontage on the public street. On all other sites with more than one street \nfrontage, the applicant may choose on which frontage to meet the standards; \n4.  Development on flag lots or on lots that slope up or down from the street with an \naverage slope of 20 percent or more is exempt from these standards;  \n5.  Subdivisions and PUDs that received preliminary plan approval between September 9, \n1990, and September 9, 1995, are exempt from these standards; and  \n6. Development on lots where any portion of the lot is in the combined flood hazard \narea is exempt from the standard in Subsection D. \nC. Location. At least one main entrance for each structure must: \n1. Be within 8 feet of the longest street-facing wall of the dwelling unit; and   Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  1/1/25 \n110-20 \n2.  Either: \na.  Face the street. See Figure 110-5;  \nb. Be at an angle of up to 45 degrees from the street; or \nc. Open onto a porch. See Figure 110-6. The porch must: \n(1)  Be at least 25 square feet in area; \n(2)  Have at least one entrance facing the street; and \n(3)  Have a roof that is: \n• No more than 12 feet above the floor of the porch; and \n• At least 30 percent solid. This standard may be met by having 30 \npercent of the porch area covered with a solid roof, or by having the \nentire area covered with a trellis or other open material if no more than \n70 percent of the area of the material is open. \nD.  Distance from grade. The main entrance that meets Subsection C must be within 4 feet of \ngrade. For the purposes of this Subsection, grade is the average grade measured at the \nouter most corners of the street facing façade. See Figure 110-7.  \nFigure 110-5 \nMain Entrance Facing the Street \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.110 \n1/1/25  Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n110-21 \nFigure 110-6 \nMain Entrance Opening onto a Porch \n \nFigure 110-7 \nCalculation of Grade: (Grade A + Grade B) / 2 \n \n33.110.235 Street-Facing Facades  \nA. Purpose. The standards: \n• Work with the main entrance and garage standards to ensures that there is a visual \nconnection between the living area of the residence and the street; \n• Enhance public safety by allowing people to survey their neighborhood from inside \ntheir residences; and \n• Provide a pleasant pedestrian environment along the street by preventing large \nexpanses of blank facades and facade-obscuring staircases from interrupting the \nconnection between the residence and the public realm.  Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  1/1/25 \n110-22 \nB. Where the standards apply.  \n1. The street-facing façade standards apply to all residential structure types in the R10 \nthrough R2.5 zones except accessory dwelling units;  \n2. Where a proposal is for an alteration or addition to existing development, the \napplicant may choose to apply the standard either to the portion being altered or \nadded, or to the entire street-facing facade. The side wall of a dormer is exempt from \nthis standard; \n3. Development on flag lots or on lots that slope up or down from the street with an \naverage slope of 20 percent or more is exempt from this standard; and  \n4. Subdivisions and PUDs that received preliminary plan approval between September 9, \n1990, and September 9, 1995, are exempt from these standards. \nC. Windows. At least 15 percent of the area of each facade that faces a street lot line must be \nwindows or main entrance doors. Windows used to meet this standard must allow views \nfrom the building to the street. Glass block does not meet this standard. Windows in \ngarage doors do not count toward meeting this standard, but windows in garage walls do \ncount toward meeting this standard. To count toward meeting this standard, a door must \nbe at the main entrance and facing a street lot line.  \nD. Exterior stairs. Fire escapes and exterior stairs providing access to an upper level are not \nallowed on any facade that faces a street lot line.  \n33.110.240 Required Outdoor Areas \nA. Purpose. The required outdoor areas standards ensure opportunities in the single-dwelling \nzones for outdoor relaxation or recreation. The standards work with the maximum building \ncoverage standards to ensure that some of the land not covered by buildings is of an \nadequate size and shape to be usable for outdoor recreation or relaxation. The location \nrequirements provide options for private or semiprivate areas. The requirement of a \nrequired outdoor area serves in lieu of a large rear setback requirement and is an \nimportant aspect in addressing the livability of a residential structure. \nB. Required outdoor area sizes. The minimum sizes of required outdoor area per lot is stated \nin Table 110-4. The shape of the outdoor area must be such that a square of the stated \ndimension will fit entirely in the outdoor area. \nC. Requirements. \n1. The required outdoor area must be a contiguous area and may be on the ground or \nabove ground.  \n2. The area must be surfaced with lawn, pavers, decking, or sport court paving which \nallows the area to be used for recreational purposes. User amenities, such as tables, \nbenches, trees, planter boxes, garden plots, drinking fountains, spas, or pools may be \nplaced in the outdoor area. It may be covered, such as a covered patio, but it may not \nbe fully enclosed. Required outdoor area may not be used as vehicle area.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.110 \n1/1/25  Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n110-23 \n3. General landscaped areas that are included as part of the required outdoor area may \nextend into the required side and rear building setback, but the required outdoor area \nmay not be located in the front building setback. \n33.110.245 Detached and Connected Accessory Structures \nA. Purpose. This section regulates detached and connected structures that are incidental to \nprimary buildings to prevent them from becoming the predominant element of the site. \nThe standards limit the height and bulk of these structures, promote compatibility of \ndesign for larger structures, provide for necessary access around larger structures, help \nmaintain privacy between abutting lots, and maintain open front setbacks.  \nB. General standards. \n1. The regulations of this section apply to detached accessory structures and connected \naccessory structures. Farm structures associated with an agricultural use such as barns \nand silos are exempt from these standards as long as they are set back from all lot \nlines at least one foot for every foot in height. Additional regulations for accessory \ndwelling units are stated in Chapter 33.205. \n2. Detached accessory structures are allowed on a lot only in conjunction with a primary \nbuilding and may not exist on a lot prior to the construction of the primary structure, \nexcept as allowed by Paragraph B.3. \n3. A detached accessory structure that becomes the only structure on a lot as the result \nof a land division, a property line adjustment, a lot confirmation, or a demolition of \nthe primary structure may remain on the lot if the owner has executed a covenant \nwith the City that meets the requirements of Section 33.700.060.  \na. For a land division, the covenant must require the owner to remove the \naccessory structure if, within two years of final plat approval, a primary structure \nhas not been built and received final inspection. The covenant must be executed \nwith the City prior to final plat approval. \nb. For a property line adjustment or a lot confirmation, the covenant must require \nthe owner to remove the accessory structure if a primary structure has not been \nbuilt and received final inspection within two years. The two years begins on the \ndate the letter from PP&D approving the property line adjustment or lot \nconfirmation is mailed. The covenant must be executed with the City before the \nfinal letter from PP&D is issued. \nc. For a demolition of a primary structure, the covenant must require the owner to \nremove the accessory structure if a new primary structure has not been built and \nreceived final inspection within two years. The two years begins on the date of \nthe final inspection of the demolition. The covenant must be executed with the \nCity prior to the issuance of the demolition permit. \nC. Detached and connected covered accessory structures. The following standards apply to \nall detached covered accessory structures and connected covered accessory structures. \nDetached covered accessory structures are items such as garages, carports, greenhouses, \nartist’s studios, guest houses, accessory dwelling units, storage buildings, wood sheds,  Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  1/1/25 \n110-24 \nwater collection cisterns, and covered decks or patios that are not connected to the \nprimary structure. Connected covered accessory structures include accessory structures \nthat are connected to a primary structure via a roofed structure such as a breezeway. The \nstandards of this subsection do not apply to the portion of the structure that connects the \naccessory structure to the primary structure. Garages are also subject to the standards of \n33.110.250.  \n1. Height. The maximum height allowed for all detached covered accessory structures \nand connected covered accessory structures is 20 feet. \n2. Setbacks. Except as follows, detached covered accessory structures and connected \ncovered accessory structures are subject to required building setbacks.

Planned development. See Chapter 33.270, Planned Developments. \n33.110.270 Institutional Development Standards  \nA. Purpose. The general base zone development standards are designed for residential \nbuildings. Different development standards are needed for institutional uses which may be  Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  1/1/25 \n110-46 \nallowed in single-dwelling zones. The intent is to maintain compatibility with and limit the \nnegative impacts on surrounding residential areas. \nB. Use categories to which these standards apply. The standards of this section apply to uses \nin the institutional group of use categories, whether allowed by right, allowed with \nlimitations, or subject to a conditional use review. The standards apply to new \ndevelopment, exterior alterations, and conversions to institutional uses. Recreational fields \nused for organized sports on a school, school site, or in a park, are subject to Chapter \n33.279, Recreational Fields for Organized Sports.  \nC. The standards.  \n1.

Recreational fields used for organized sports \non a school, school site, or in a park, are subject to Chapter 33.279, Recreational Fields \nfor Organized Sports.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.110 \n1/1/25  Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n110-47 \n6.  Mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment located on the ground, such as heating \nor cooling equipment, pumps, or generators must be screened from the street and \nany abutting residential zones by walls, fences, or vegetation. Screening must comply \nwith at least the L2 or F2 standards of Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening, \nand be tall enough to screen the equipment. Mechanical equipment placed on roofs \nmust be screened in one of the following ways, if the equipment is within 50 feet of an \nabutting R zoned lot: \na.  A parapet along facades facing the R zone that is as tall as the tallest part of  \nthe equipment;  \nb.  A screen around the equipment that is as tall as the tallest part of the \nequipment; or \nc.  The equipment is set back from roof edges facing the R zone 3 feet for each foot \nof height of the equipment. \n7.  Electrical substations. In addition to the standards in Table 110-9, the entire perimeter \nof electrical substations, including the street lot line (except for the access point), \nmust be landscaped to the L3 standards stated in Chapter 33.248.

The on-site pedestrian circulation system must meet the \nstandards of Section 33.120.255, Pedestrian Standards. \n \nTable 110-9 \nInstitutional Development Standards [1] \n \nMinimum Site Area for New Uses \n \n10,000 sq. ft. \nMaximum Floor Area Ratio [2] 0.5 to 1 \nMaximum Height [3] 50 ft. \nMinimum Building Setbacks [2] \n \n1 ft. back for every 2 ft. of bldg. height, but in no \ncase less than 15 ft. \nMaximum Building Setback \nTransit Street or Pedestrian District [7] \n \n20 ft. or per CU/IMP review \nTable 110-9 \nInstitutional Development Standards [1] \nMaximum Building Coverage [2] 50% of site area  Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  1/1/25 \n110-48 \nMinimum Landscaped Area [2,4] 25% of site area to the L1 standard \nBuffering from Abutting Residential Zone [5] 15 ft. to L3 standard \nBuffering Across a Street from a Residential Zone [5] 15 ft. to L1 standard \nSetbacks for All Detached Accessory Structures Except \nFences [6] \n \n10 ft. \nParking and Loading See Chapter 33.266 \nSigns See Title 32, Signs and Related Regulations \n  \n  \nNotes: \n[1] The standards of this table are minimums or maximums as indicated. Compliance with the conditional use \napproval criteria might preclude development to the maximum intensity permitted by these standards. \n[2] For campus-type developments, the entire campus is treated as one site. Setbacks are only measured \nfrom the perimeter of the site. The setbacks in this table only supersede the setbacks required in Table 110-4 \n3. The normal regulations for projections into setbacks and for detached accessory structures still apply. \n[3] Towers and spires with a footprint of 200 square feet or less may exceed the height limit, but still must \nmeet the setback standard. Elevator mechanical equipment that is set back at least 15 feet from all roof \nedges on street facing facades may extend up to 16 feet above the height limit. Other mechanical equipment \nand stairwell enclosures that provide rooftop access when these cumulatively cover no more than 10 percent \nof the roof area and are set back at least 15 feet from all roof edges on street facing facades may extend up \nto 10 feet above the height limit. \n[4] Any required landscaping, such as for required setbacks or parking lots, applies towards the landscaped \narea standard. \n[5] Vehicle areas are subject to the parking lot setback and landscaping standards stated in Chapter 33.266, \nParking, Loading And Transportation And Parking Demand Management. \n[6] Setbacks for structures that are accessory to recreational fields for organized sports on a school, school \nsite, or in a park, are stated in Chapter 33.279, Recreational Fields for Organized Sports.  \n[7] The maximum building setbacks are described in 33.110.270.C. \n33.110.275 Fences \nA. Purpose. The fence standards promote the positive benefits of fences without negatively \nimpacting the community or endangering public or vehicle safety. Fences can create a \nsense of privacy, protect children and pets, provide separation from busy streets, and \nenhance the appearance of property by providing attractive landscape materials. The \nnegative effects of fences can include the creation of street walls that inhibit police and \ncommunity surveillance, decrease the sense of community, hinder emergency access, \nhinder the safe movement of pedestrians and vehicles, and create an unattractive \nappearance. These standards are intended to promote the positive aspects of fences and to \nlimit the negative ones.  \nB. Types of fences. The standards apply to walls, fences, and screens of all types whether \nopen, solid, wood, metal, wire, masonry, or other material. \nC. Location and height.  \n1. Front building setbacks. Fences up to 3-1/2 feet high are allowed in required front \nbuilding setbacks, or between the front lot line and the front building line of the \nprimary structure, whichever is less. \n2. Side and rear building setbacks.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.110 \n1/1/25  Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n110-49 \na. Fences up to 8 feet high are allowed in required side or rear building setbacks \nthat do not abut a pedestrian connection. \nb. Fences abutting a pedestrian connection. \n(1) Fences up to 8 feet high are allowed in required side or rear building \nsetbacks that abut a pedestrian connection if the pedestrian connection is \npart of a right-of-way that is at least 30 feet wide. \n(2) Fences up to 3-1/2 feet high are allowed in required side or rear building \nsetbacks that abut a pedestrian connection if the pedestrian connection is \npart of a right-of-way that is less than 30 feet wide. \n3. Exceptions for corner lots. On corner lots, if the main entrance is on the facade facing \nthe side street lot line, the applicant may elect to meet the following instead of C.1 \nand C.2. See Figure 110-15. \na. Fences up to 3-1/2 feet high are allowed within the first 10 feet of the side street \nlot line. \nb. Fences up to 3-1/2 feet high are allowed in required setbacks that abut a \npedestrian connection if the pedestrian connection is part of a right-of-way that \nis less than 30 feet wide; \nc. Fences up to 8 feet high are allowed in the required front building setback, \noutside of the area subject to 3.a. \nd. Fences up to 8 feet high are allowed in all other side or rear building setbacks. \n4. Not in building setbacks. The height for fences that are not in required building \nsetbacks is the same as the regular height limits of the zone.

Electrified fences are regulated under Title 26, Electrical \nRegulations. The use of barbed wire is regulated under Title 24, Building Regulations. \n33.110.280 Retaining Walls \nA. Purpose. The standards of this section help mitigate the potential negative effects of large \nretaining walls. Without mitigation, such walls can create a fortress-like appearance and be \nunattractive. By requiring large walls to step back from the street and provide landscaping, \nthe wall is both articulated and visually softened. \nB. Where these regulations apply. \n1. Generally. These regulations apply to the portions of street-facing retaining walls that \nare in required setbacks along street lot lines. Where there is no required setback, or \nthe setback is less than 10 feet, the regulations apply to the first 10 feet from the line. \n2. Exceptions. The following are not subject to the regulations of this section: \na. Retaining walls in the areas described in B.1 that are less than four feet high, as \nmeasured from the bottom of the footing. \nb. Retaining walls on sites where the site slopes downward from a street in the area \ndescribed in B.1. \nc. Retaining walls on sites where the site slopes upward from a street and the \nexisting slope within the area regulated by B.1 is 50 percent or more. \nd. Replacing an existing retaining wall, where the replacement will not be taller or \nwider than the existing wall.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.110 \n3/1/25  Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n110-51 \ne. Retaining walls on sites where any portion of the site is in an environmental \noverlay zone. \nC. Standards. \n1. Retaining walls are limited to 4 feet in height measured from the bottom of the \nfooting, as shown in Figure 110-16. \n2. Retaining walls must be set back at least 3 feet from other street-facing retaining \nwalls, as shown in Figure 110-16. The 3 foot setback area must be landscaped to at \nleast the L2 standard, except that trees are not required. A wall or berm may not be \nsubstituted for the shrubs. \n33.110.285 Demolitions \nA. Generally. Demolition on a site that requires a demolition permit is subject to the tree \npreservation and protection requirements of Title 11, Trees. See Chapter 11.50, Trees in \nDevelopment Situations. \nB. Historic resources. Demolition of historic resources is regulated by Chapter 33.445, Historic \nResource Overlay Zone.  \n33.110.290 Nonconforming Development \nExisting developments that do not conform to the development standards of this chapter may be \nsubject to the regulations of Chapter 33.258, Nonconforming Situations. \nFigure 110-16 \nRetaining Walls \n  Chapter 33.110 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSingle-Dwelling Zones  3/1/25 \n110-52 \n \n33.110.292 Parking and Loading \nFor parking and loading regulations, see Chapter 33.266, Parking, Loading, and Transportation and \nParking Demand Management. \n33.110.295 Signs \nThe sign regulations are stated in Title 32, Signs and Related Regulations. \n33.110.296 Recycling Areas \nRequirements for recycling areas are regulated by the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability.

Use regulations. The use regulations are intended to create and maintain higher density \nresidential neighborhoods. At the same time, they allow for institutional, limited \ncommercial, and other nonresidential uses, but not to such an extent as to sacrifice the \noverall residential neighborhood character of the multi-dwelling zones and their intended \nrole as places for housing.  \nB. Development standards. The six multi-dwelling zones are distinguished primarily by their \nallowed scale and development standards. The development standards work together to \ncreate desirable residential areas by promoting aesthetically pleasing environments, safety, \nprivacy, energy conservation, and recreational opportunities. The development standards \ngenerally assure that new development will be compatible with the City’s character and \ncontribute to the intended characteristics of each zone. At the same time, the standards \nallow for flexibility for new development. In addition, the regulations provide certainty to \nproperty owners, developers, and neighbors about the limits of what is allowed. The \ndevelopment standards are generally written for development on flat, regularly shaped \nlots. Other situations are addressed through special standards or exceptions. \n33.120.020 List of the Multi-Dwelling Zones \nThe full and short names of the multi-dwelling residential zones and their map symbols are listed \nbelow. When this Title refers to the multi-dwelling zones, it is referring to the six zones listed here. \nWhen this Title refers to the residential zones or R zones, it is referring to both the single-dwelling \nzones in Chapter 33.110 and the multi-dwelling zones in this chapter. \nFull Name Short Name/Map Symbol \nResidential Multi-Dwelling 1 RM1 \nResidential Multi-Dwelling 2 RM2 \nResidential Multi-Dwelling 3 RM3 \nResidential Multi-Dwelling 4 RM4 \nCentral Residential RX \nResidential Manufactured Dwelling Park RMP \n33.120.030 Characteristics Of The Zones \nA. RM1 zone. The RM1 zone is a low-scale multi-dwelling zone that is generally applied in \nlocations intended to provide a transition in scale to single-dwelling residential areas, such \nas the edges of mixed-use centers and civic corridors, and along or near neighborhood \ncorridors. Allowed housing is characterized by one to three story buildings that relate to   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-3 \n \nthe patterns of residential neighborhoods, but at a somewhat larger scale and building \ncoverage than allowed in the single-dwelling zones. The major types of new development \nwill be duplexes, triplexes, rowhouses, courtyard housing, small apartment buildings, and \nother relatively small-scale multi-dwelling and small-lot housing types that are compatible \nwith the characteristics of Portland’s residential neighborhoods. \nB. RM2 zone. The RM2 zone is a medium-scale multi-dwelling zone that is generally applied in \nand around a variety of centers and corridors that are well-served by transit. Allowed \nhousing is characterized by buildings of up to three or four stories with a higher percentage \nof building coverage than in the RM1 zone, while still providing opportunities for \nlandscaping and outdoor spaces that integrate with residential neighborhood \ncharacteristics. The major types of new housing development will be a diverse range of \nmulti-dwelling structures and other compact housing that contribute to the intended urban \nscale of centers and corridors, while providing transitions in scale and characteristics to \nlower-scale residential neighborhoods. \nC. RM3 zone. The RM3 zone is a medium to high density multi-dwelling zone applied near the \nCentral City, and in centers, station areas, and along civic corridors that are served by \nfrequent transit and are close to commercial services. It is intended for compact, urban \ndevelopment with a high percentage of building coverage and a strong building orientation \nto the pedestrian environment of streets. This zone is intended for areas where the \nestablished residential character includes landscaped front setbacks. Allowed housing is \ncharacterized by mid-rise buildings up to six stories tall. The Design overlay zone is applied \nto this zone. \nD. RM4 zone. The RM4 zone is a high density, urban-scale multi-dwelling zone applied near \nthe Central City, and in town centers, station areas, and along civic corridors that are \nserved by frequent transit and are close to commercial services. It is intended to be an \nintensely urban zone with a high percentage of building coverage and a strong building \norientation to the pedestrian environment of streets, with buildings located close to \nsidewalks with little or no front setback. This is a mid-rise to high-rise zone with buildings of \nup to seven or more stories. The Design overlay zone is applied to this zone. \nE. RX zone. The RX zone is a high density multi-dwelling zone that allows the greatest \nintensity of development scale in the residential zones. The zone is applied within \nPortland’s most intensely urban areas, specifically the Central City and the Gateway \nRegional Center. Allowed housing development is characterized by large buildings with a \nvery high percentage of building coverage. The major types of new housing development \nwill be mid-rise and high-rise multi-dwelling structures, often with allowed retail, \ninstitutional, or other service oriented uses. Development is intended to be pedestrian-\noriented, with buildings that contribute to an urban environment with a strong street edge \nof buildings located close to sidewalks. The Design overlay zone is applied to this zone. \nF. RMP zone. The RMP zone is a low-scale multi-dwelling zone that allows manufactured \ndwelling parks. Allowed density may be up to 29 units per acre. Allowed housing is \nmanufactured dwellings that are assembled off-site. Units are generally surrounded by \nvehicle circulation systems, pedestrian pathways and open area, often resulting in lower \nbuilding coverage than other multi-dwelling zones. Development is compatible with low- \nand medium-density single-dwelling development and multi-dwelling development. \nGenerally, RMP zoning will be applied on large sites.   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-4 \n \n33.120.040 Other Zoning Regulations \nThe regulations in this chapter state the allowed uses and development standards for the base \nzones. Sites with overlay zones, plan districts, or designated historical landmarks are subject to \nadditional regulations. The Official Zoning Maps indicate which sites are subject to these additional \nregulations. Specific uses or development types may also be subject to regulations in the 200s series \nof chapters. \n33.120.050 Neighborhood Contact \nNeighborhood contact is a set of outreach steps that must be taken before certain developments \ncan be submitted for approval. Neighborhood contact is required as follows: \nA. Neighborhood contact I. \n1. Neighborhood contact I requirements. When proposed development will add at least \n10,000 square feet and not more than 25,000 square feet of net building area to a \nsite, the neighborhood contact steps of 33.705.020.A., Neighborhood contact I, are \nrequired. All the steps in 33.705.020.A. must be completed before an application for a \nbuilding permit can be submitted. \n2. Exemption. If the proposed development has already met the neighborhood contact \nrequirements as part of a land use review process, it is exempt from the neighborhood \ncontact requirements.  \nB. Neighborhood contact II. \n1. Neighborhood contact II requirements. When the proposed development will add \nmore than 25,000 square feet of net building area to a site, the neighborhood contact \nsteps of 33.705.020.B., Neighborhood contact II, are required. All of the steps in \n33.705.020.B. must be completed before an application for a building permit can be \nsubmitted. \n2. Exemption. If the proposed development has already met the neighborhood contact \nrequirements as part of a land use review process, it is exempt from the neighborhood \ncontact requirements. \nUse Regulations \n33.120.100 Primary Uses \nA.

Purpose. The regulations of this section require lots, adjusted lots, lot remnants, and lots of \nrecord to be an adequate size so that new development on a site will in most cases be able \nto comply with all site development standards, including density. Allowing the ownership \nto be separated may increase opportunities for residential infill while preserving existing \nhousing.   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-10 \n \nB. Where these regulations apply. These regulations apply to lots, adjusted lots, lot \nremnants, and lots of record in the multi-dwelling zones. The creation of new lots is subject \nto the lot size standards listed in Chapter 33.612, Lots in Multi-Dwelling Zones.  \nC. Primary structures allowed. Development of a primary structure is allowed as follows: \n1. On a lot or adjusted lot created on or after July 26, 1979; \n2.

The purpose of the minimum required site frontage standard is to ensure that \nsites in and around certain centers in Eastern Portland have sufficient street frontage and \nsite area to: \n• Accommodate new streets where pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular connectivity is \nlacking; \n• Foster efficient site design;  \n• Allow for buildings with an orientation to the street; and  \n• Provide opportunities to create outdoor space and preserve trees.   \nB. Where the standard applies. The minimum required site frontage standard applies in the \nmulti-dwelling zones to sites shown on Map 120-2.   \nC. Minimum required site frontage standard.  \n1. Standard. If the site is more than 160 feet deep, new dwelling units are prohibited \nunless the site has at least 90 feet of frontage on a street. Adjustments to reduce the \nrequired amount of frontage by up to 10 percent may be requested prior to January 2, \n2032. Beginning January 2, 2032, adjustments are prohibited. \n2. Exceptions. The following exceptions apply:  \na. Adding an accessory dwelling unit to a lot with an existing house, existing \nattached house, existing manufactured home, or existing duplex is allowed;  \nb. Development is allowed on a site when all of the lots that share a side lot line \nwith the development site meets at least one of the following: \n(1) The lot is zoned multi-dwelling and meets the minimum density standard for \nthe base zone;  \n(2) The lot is zoned multi-dwelling and has at least three primary dwelling units \non the lot; or \n(3) The lot is not zoned multi-dwelling. \nc. Development approved through a Planned Development Review is allowed.

Purpose. Floor area ratios (FARs) regulate the amount of use (the intensity) allowed on a \nsite. FARs provide a means to match the potential amount of uses with the desired \ncharacter of the area and the provision of public services. FARs also work with the height, \nsetback, and building coverage standards to control the overall bulk of development. \nB. FAR standard. The maximum floor area ratios are stated in Table 120-4 and apply to all \nuses and development. In the RM4 zone the maximum FAR is 4 to 1, except in Historic \nDistricts and Conservation Districts, where the maximum FAR is 3 to 1. Floor area ratio is \nnot applicable in the RMP zone. There is no maximum limit on the number of dwelling units \nwithin the allowable floor area, but the units must comply with all building and housing \ncode requirements. Additional floor area may be allowed through bonus options described \nin Section 33.120.211, or transferred as described in Subsection D. Maximum FAR does not \napply to one alteration or addition of up to 250 square feet when the alteration or addition \nis to a primary structure that received final inspection at least 5 years ago. This exception is \nallowed once every 5 years. Adjustments to the maximum floor area ratios are prohibited. \nFloor area does not include the following: \n1. Floor area for structured parking when at least 50 percent, or 6, of the parking spaces \nin the structure, whichever is greater, have at least a Level 2 charger adjacent to the \nspace, up to a maximum of 0.5 to 1;  \n2. Floor area for required long term bicycle parking that is not located in a dwelling unit, \nup to a maximum of 0.5 to 1; and  \n3. Floor area for indoor common area used to meet the requirements of Section \n33.120.240. \nC. Maximum increase in FAR. An increase in FAR using bonuses and transfers of more than is \nstated in Table 120-5 is prohibited. This total FAR includes FAR transferred from another \nsite, and any additional FAR allowed from bonus options. \nD. Transfer of FAR. FAR may be transferred from one site to another subject to the following: \n1. Sending site. FAR may be transferred from: \na. A site where all existing dwelling units are affordable to those earning no more \nthan 60 percent of the area median family income. In order to qualify for this \ntransfer, the applicant must provide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau \ncertifying that this affordability standard and any administrative requirements \nhave been met. The letter must be submitted before a building permit can be \nissued for the development, but is not required in order to apply for a land use \nreview; \nb. A site where trees that are at least 12 inches in diameter are preserved. The \nmaximum amount of floor area that may be transferred for each preserved tree \nis indicated in Table 120-5, however the maximum amount of FAR that can be \ntransferred may not exceed the total amount of unused FAR on the site. This \ntransfer provision does not apply to dead, dying or dangerous, or nuisance trees. \nTo qualify for this transfer, a report is required from the City Forester or a   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-14 \n \ncertified arborist documenting that the trees to be preserved are not nuisance \ntrees and are not dead, dying or dangerous; or \nc. A site that contains a Historic or Conservation Landmark or a contributing \nresource in a Historic or Conservation District. Sites that are eligible to send floor \narea through this transfer are allowed to transfer: \n(1) Unused FAR up to the maximum FAR allowed by the zone; and  \n(2) An additional amount equivalent to 50 percent of the maximum FAR for the \nzone. To qualify to transfer this additional amount of FAR, Portland \nPermitting & Development must verify that the landmark or contributing \nresource on the site meets one of the following:  \n• If the building is classified as Risk category I or II, as defined in the \nOregon Structural Specialty Code, it has been shown to meet or exceed \nthe American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 41- BPOE improvement \nstandard as defined in City of Portland Title 24.85; \n• If the building is classified as Risk category III or IV, as defined in the \nOregon Structural Specialty Code, it has been shown to meet or exceed \nthe ASCE41- BPON improvement standard as defined in City of Portland \nTitle 24.85; or \n• The owner of the landmark or contributing resource has entered into a \nphased seismic agreement with the City of Portland as described in \nSection 24.85. \n2. Receiving site. The transfer must be to a site zoned RM1, RM2, RM3, RM4, RX, CM1, \nCM2, CM3, or CE outside of the Central City plan district. Transferring to a site zoned \nRMP is prohibited. Transferring to a site where a Historic or Conservation Landmark or \na contributing structure in a Historic or Conservation District has been demolished \nwithin the past ten years is prohibited unless the landmark or contributing structure \nwas destroyed by fire or other causes beyond the control of the owner, the only \nstructure on the site that was demolished was an accessory structure, or the \ndemolition was approved through demolition review. \n3. Maximum increase in FAR. An increase in FAR on the receiving site of more than 1 to 1 \nfrom a transfer is prohibited. In addition, the total FAR on the receiving site, including \nFAR from transfers and bonuses, may not exceed the overall maximum FAR with other \nbonuses stated in Table 120-56.  \n4. Covenants. The property owner must execute a covenant with the City that meets the \nrequirements of Section 33.700.060 and is attached to, and recorded with, the deeds \nof both the site transferring and the site receiving the density. The covenant must \nreflect the respective increase and decrease of potential FAR. In addition, the \ncovenant for the site where trees will be preserved must: \n(a) Require that all trees be preserved for at least 50 years; and  \n(b) Require that any tree covered by the covenant that is dead, dying or dangerous \nbe removed and replaced within a 12-month period. The trees must be \ndetermined to be dead, dying, or dangerous by the City Forester or a certified \narborist. If a tree covered by the covenant is removed in violation of the   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-15 \n \nrequirements of this Section, or is dead, dying, or dangerous as the result of a \nviolation, Tree Review is required. \n \nTable 120-5 \nTransferable Floor Area for Tree Preservation in Multi-Dwelling Zones \nDiameter of Tree Preserved \nTransferable Floor Area for Each Tree (by zone) \nRM1 RM2 RM3 RM4 & RX \n12 to 19 inches 1,000 sq. ft.  1,500 sq. ft. 2,000 sq. ft. 4,000 sq. ft. \n20 to 35 inches 2,000 sq. ft. 3,000 sq. ft. 4,000 sq. ft. 8,000 sq. ft. \n36 inches or greater  4,000 sq. ft. 6,000 sq. ft. 8,000 sq. ft. 16,000 sq. ft. \n33.120.211 Floor Area Bonus Options \nA. Purpose and description. The bonus options allow additional floor area as an incentive for \ndevelopment that includes affordable housing, family-sized units, or units that are \nphysically accessible to people of all abilities. The bonus options are designed to allow \nadditional development intensity in a manner that is consistent with the purposes of the \nmulti-dwelling zones.  \nB. General floor area bonus regulations. \n1. The floor area bonus options in this section are only allowed in the RM1, RM2, RM3, \nRM4, and RX zones outside the Central City and Gateway plan districts. Sites where a \nHistoric or Conservation Landmark or a contributing structure in a Historic or \nConservation District has been demolished within the past ten years are not eligible to \nuse bonus options unless the landmark or contributing structure was destroyed by fire \nor other causes beyond the control of the owner, the only structure on the site that \nwas demolished was an accessory structure, or the demolition was approved through \ndemolition review. \n2. More than one bonus may be used up to the overall maximum per site stated in Table \n120-6. Adjustments to the maximum amount of floor area obtainable through \nbonuses are prohibited. \n3. The increment of additional FAR allowed per bonus is stated in Table 120-6 and \ndescribed in Subsection C.  \n4. The bonus option standards must be met in full to receive the bonus.   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-16 \n \n \nTable 120-6 \nSummary of Bonus FAR  \n RM1 RM2 RM3 RM4 & RX \nOverall Maximum Per Site [1] \nMaximum FAR with deeper housing \naffordability bonus  \n(see 33.120.211.C.2) \n2 to 1 3 to 1 4 to 1 7 to 1 or \n6 to 1 [3] \n \nMaximum FAR with other bonuses [2]  1.5 to 1 2.25 to 1 3 to 1 \n \n6 to 1 or \n4.5 to 1 [3] \nIncrement of Additional FAR Per Bonus \nInclusionary Housing  \n(see 33.120.211.C.1) \n0.5 to 1 \n \n0.75 to 1 \n \n1 to 1 \n \n2 to 1 or \n1.5 to 1 [3] \n \nDeeper Housing Affordability \n(see 33.120.211.C.2) \n1 to 1 1.5 to 1 2 to 1 3 to 1 \nThree-Bedroom Units \n(see 33.120.211.C.3) \n0.25 to 1 \n \n0.4 to 1 \n \n0.5 to 1  \n \n1 to 1 or \n0.75 to 1 [3] \n \nVisitable Units \n(see 33.120.211.C.4) \n0.25 to 1 \n \n0.4 to 1 \n \n0.5 to 1  \n \n1 to 1 or \n0.75 to 1 [3] \n \n[1] Overall maximum FAR includes FAR received from a transfer. \n[2] Other bonuses are the Inclusionary Housing, Three-Bedroom Units, and Visitable Units bonuses.  \n[3] The lower FAR applies in the RM4 zone in Historic and Conservation districts.  \nC. Bonus options. \n1. Inclusionary housing bonus option. Maximum FAR may be increased as stated in Table \n120-6 if one of the following is met:  \na. Mandatory inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR is allowed up to the maximum with \ninclusionary housing bonus stated in Table 120-6 for development that triggers \nthe requirements of 33.245, Inclusionary Housing. To qualify for this bonus, the \napplicant must provide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that \nthe regulations of 33.245 have been met; or \nb. Voluntary inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR is allowed up to the maximum with \ninclusionary housing bonus stated in Table 120-6 when one of the following \nvoluntary bonus options is met:  \n(1) Bonus FAR is allowed for projects that voluntarily comply with the standards \nof 33.245.040 and 33.245.050. To qualify for this bonus, the applicant must \nprovide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the \nregulations of 33.245 have been met. The letter must be submitted before a \nbuilding permit can be issued for the development, but is not required in \norder to apply for a land use review; or    \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-17 \n \n(2) Bonus FAR is allowed in exchange for payment into the Affordable Housing \nFund. For each square foot of floor area purchased a fee must be paid to the \nPortland Housing Bureau (PHB). The Portland Housing Bureau collects and \nadministers the Affordable Housing Fund and determines the fee. PHB \ndetermines the fee per square foot and updates the fee at least every three \nyears. The fee schedule is available from Portland Permitting & \nDevelopment. To qualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a letter \nfrom PHB documenting the amount that has been contributed. The letter is \nrequired to be submitted before a building permit can be issued for \ndevelopment but is not required in order to apply for a land use review. \n2. Deeper housing affordability bonus option. Bonus FAR is allowed up to the maximum \nwith deeper housing affordability bonus as stated in Table 120-6 when at least 50 \npercent of all the dwelling units on the site are affordable to those earning no more \nthan 60 percent of area median family income or an affordability level established by \nTitle 30. Projects taking advantage of this bonus are also allowed an additional 10 feet \nof base height and an additional 10 percent of building coverage beyond the limits for \nthe zone stated in Table 120-4. To qualify for this bonus the applicant must provide a \nletter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the development meets the \naffordability requirement of this bonus and any administrative requirements of the \nPortland Housing Bureau. The letter must be submitted before a building permit can \nbe issued for the development but is not required in order to apply for a land use \nreview. \n3. Three-bedroom unit bonus option. Bonus FAR is allowed up to the maximum with \nthree-bedroom unit bonus as stated in Table 120-6 if at least 50 percent of the \ndwelling units on the site have at least three bedrooms and are affordable to those \nearning no more than 100 percent of the area median family income. To qualify for \nthis bonus, the applicant must provide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau \ncertifying that the required three-bedroom units meet the affordability requirement \nof this bonus and any administrative requirements of the Portland Housing Bureau.   \n4. Visitable units bonus option. Bonus FAR is allowed up to the maximum with visitable \nunits bonus as stated in Table 120-6 when at least 25 percent of all the dwelling units \non the site meet the following visitability standards, except that this bonus is not \navailable for projects with buildings that are required by the Oregon Structural \nSpecialty Code to include Type A or Type B accessible units: \na. Visitable entrance. At least one entrance must be accessible via a route that does \nnot have any stairs between it and the street lot line or an on-site parking space. \nThe slope of the route may not exceed 1:8; \nb. Visitable bathroom. At least one bathroom with a sink and toilet must be \ndesigned to accommodate an unobstructed circle that is at least 60-inches in \ndiameter. As an alternative, the bathroom may be designed to accommodate an \nunobstructed area that is comprised of two rectangles that are at least 36 inches \nby 60 inches, and oriented at right angles to each other. See Figure 120-1. The \nvisitable bathroom must be on the same floor as the visitable entrance or be \naccessible from the visitable entrance via a ramp, elevator or lift. Adjustments \nare prohibited;   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-18 \n \nc. Visitable living area. There must be at least 200 square feet of living area on the \nsame floor as the visitable entrance or 200 square feet of living area must be \naccessible from the visitable entrance via a ramp, elevator or lift. Adjustments \nare prohibited; and \nd. Visitable doors. All door openings between and including the visitable entrance, \nvisitable living area, and the visitable bathroom must be at least 34 inches wide. \nAdjustments are prohibited. \n33.120.212 Maximum Density  \nA. Purpose. The maximum number of dwellings per unit of land, the maximum density, is \ncontrolled in the RMP zone so that housing can match the availability of public services and \nthe availability of support commercial areas. The standards also allow the housing density \nto be matched with the carrying capacity of the land. In addition, the density standard is \nused as one type of control of overall building bulk. The bonus density options allow \nadditional floor area as an incentive for providing affordable housing. \nB. Maximum density. The maximum density for the RMP zone is stated in Table 120-4. There \nis no maximum density for any other multi-dwelling zone. All new housing built, or \nconverted from other uses, must be on sites large enough to comply with the density \nstandards. The number of units allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all site \ndevelopment standards will be met. The allowed density is not a special right that justifies \nadjusting other development standards.  \nC. RMP zone affordable housing bonus option. In the RMP zone, maximum density can be \nincreased up to the maximum with RMP affordable housing bonus stated in Table 120-4 \nwhen at least 50 percent of all of the dwelling units on the site are affordable to those \nearning no more than 60 percent of area median family income. To qualify for this bonus \nthe applicant must provide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the \ndevelopment meets the affordability requirement of this bonus and any administrative \nrequirements of the Portland Housing Bureau. The letter must be submitted before a \nbuilding permit can be issued for development, but is not required in order to apply for a \nland use review.   \nD. Transfer of density.  \n1. Density may be transferred from a site zoned RMP to a site zoned RM1, RM2, RM3, or \nRM4 outside of the Central City plan district. When density will be transferred from a \nsite zoned RMP, one dwelling unit is equal to 800 square feet of floor area. Transfers \nof density or FAR to a site zoned RMP is prohibited. \n2. The property owner must execute a covenant with the City that is attached to, and \nrecorded with, the deed of both the site transferring and the site receiving the density \nreflecting the respective increase and decrease of potential density. The covenant for \nthe receiving site must meet the requirements of Section 33.700.060.   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-19 \n \nFigure 120-1 \nVisitable Bathroom Clearances \n \n33.120.213 Minimum Density  \nA. Purpose. The minimum density standards ensure that the service capacity is effectively \nutilized and that the City's housing goals are met. The standards also ensure that \nincremental development will not preclude the ability to meet the intended development \nintensity of the zoning of a site. \nB. Minimum density. The minimum density requirements for the multi-dwelling zones are \nstated in Table 120-4. Group living uses are exempt from minimum density requirements. \nLand within an Environmental zone may be subtracted from the calculation of minimum \ndensity.  \n1. If units are being added to a site with an existing building with residential units, the \nminimum density is reduced by two units. \n2. In the RMP zone, if maximum density is two units then minimum density is two units. \nIf maximum density is one unit, minimum density is one unit. \n3. On sites where trees that are 12 or more inches in diameter are proposed for \npreservation, minimum density may be reduced as follows: \na. The maximum allowed reduction in minimum density is shown in Table 120-7. \nb. When this provision is used to reduce density, the owner must execute a \ncovenant with the City.  The covenant is not required if the site is also part of a \nproposed Land Division.  The covenant must: \n(1) Require that all trees used to reduce the minimum density be preserved for \nat least 10 years;   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-20 \n \n(2) Allow trees used to reduce the minimum density that die, are dying, or \nbecome dangerous to be removed and replaced within the 10 year \npreservation period.  The trees must be determined to be dead, dying, or \ndangerous by an arborist, and a Title 11 tree permit must be obtained.  If a \ntree used to reduce the minimum density is dead, dying, or dangerous as \nthe result of a violation, Tree Review is required; and  \n(3) The covenant must meet the requirements of Section 33.700.060 and be \nrecorded before a development permit is issued. \n \nTable 120-7 \nReduction in Minimum Residential Density from Tree Preservation \nRequired Minimum Residential \nDensity \nNo. of 12-Inch Trees To Be \nPreserved \nReduction of Minimum \nResidential Density \nUp to 7 units 1 1 \n8-12 units 1 1 \n 2 or more 2 \n13-17 units 1 1 \n 2 2 \n 3 or more 3 \n18 or more units 1 1 \n 2 2 \n 3 3 \n 4 or more 4 \n33.120.215 Height \nA. Purpose. The height standards serve several purposes: \n• They promote a reasonable building scale and relationship of one residence  \nto another; \n• They promote options for privacy for neighboring properties; and  \n• They reflect the general building scale of multi-dwelling development in the City's \nneighborhoods. \nB. Height standard.  \n1. Base height. The base heights allowed in the multi-dwelling zones are stated in Table \n120-4. The maximum height standard for institutional uses is stated in 33.120.275, \nDevelopment Standards for Institutions. The maximum height standards for detached \naccessory structures are stated in 33.120.280, Detached Accessory Structures. In the \nRM4 zone the base height is 75 feet, except as follows: \na. On sites that are not within a Historic or Conservation district but are within 500 \nfeet of a transit street with 20-minute peak hour service the base height is 100 \nfeet; and \nb. On sites within 1,000 feet of a transit station the base height is 100 feet, \nincluding on sites that are within a Historic or Conservation district.   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-21 \n \n2. Step-down height. In the following situations, the base height is reduced, or stepped-\ndown: \na. On the portion of a site within 25 feet of a lot line abutting a site zoned RF \nthrough R2.5, the step-down height is 35 feet. See Figure 120-2. Sites with \nproperty lines that abut a single-dwelling zone for less than a 5-foot length are \nexempt from this standard; and \nb. On the portion of the site within 15 feet of a lot line that is across a local service \nstreet or alley from a site zoned RF through R2.5 the following step-down height \nlimits apply. The limits do not apply to portions of buildings within 100 feet of a \ntransit street. \n(1) The step-down height is 45 feet for sites in the RM2, RM3, RM4, and RX \nzones. \n(2) The step-down height is 35 feet for sites in the RM1 and RMP zones. \nFigure 120-2 \nStep-Down Height Adjacent to Single-Dwelling Zones \n \nC. Exceptions to the maximum height. \n1. Chimneys, vents, flag poles, satellite receiving dishes, and other similar items, with a \nwidth, depth, or diameter of 5 feet or less may extend above the height limit, as long \nas they are attached to a building and do not exceed 5 feet above the top of the   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-22 \n \nhighest point of the roof. If they are greater than 5 feet in width, depth, or diameter, \nthey are subject to the height limit. \n2. Parapets and railings. Parapets and rooftop railings may extend 4 feet above the \nheight limits. \n3. Walls and fences. Walls or fences located between individual rooftop decks may \nextend 6 feet above the height limit provided that the wall or fence is set back at least \n4 feet from the edges of the roof. \n4. Rooftop mechanical equipment and stairwell enclosures that provide rooftop access \nmay extend above the height limit as follows, provided that the equipment and \nenclosures are set back at least 15 feet from all roof edges on street facing facades. \na. Elevator mechanical equipment may extend up to 16 feet above the height  \nlimit; and \nb. Other mechanical equipment and stairwell enclosures that cumulatively cover no \nmore than 10 percent of the roof area may extend up to 10 feet above the  \nheight limit. \n5.

For pitched, hipped, or gambrel roofs, the roof mounted solar panel must be \nmounted no more than 12 inches from the surface of the roof at any point, and \nmay not extend above the ridgeline of the roof. The 12 inches is measured from \nthe upper side of the solar panel. \n33.120.220 Setbacks  \nA. Purpose. The building setback regulations serve several purposes: \n• They maintain light, air, separation for fire protection, and access for fire fighting; \n• They reflect the general building scale and placement of multi-dwelling development in \nthe City's neighborhoods; \n• They promote a reasonable physical relationship between residences; \n• They promote options for privacy for building residents and neighboring properties; \n• They provide adequate flexibility to site a building so that it may be compatible with \nthe neighborhood, fit the topography of the site, allow for required outdoor areas, and \nallow for architectural diversity;  \n• Setback requirements along transit streets create an environment that is inviting to \npedestrians and transit users; and   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-23 \n \n• They provide room for a car to park in front of a garage door without overhanging the \nstreet or sidewalk, and they enhance driver visibility when backing onto the street. \nB. Minimum building setbacks. The required minimum building setbacks apply to all buildings \nand structures on the site except as specified in this section. Setbacks for parking areas are \nin Chapter 33.266. \n1. Generally. The required minimum building setbacks, if any, are stated in Table 120-4. \nIn the RM3 and RM4 zones, the minimum side and rear building setbacks apply as \nfollows: \na. Buildings that are up to 55 feet tall.  The required minimum side and rear \nbuilding setback for buildings that are up to 55 feet tall is 5 feet. Minor \nprojections allowed by Paragraph 33.120.215.C do not count toward this height \nmeasurement; and  \nb. Buildings more than 55 feet tall. The required minimum side and rear building \nsetback for buildings that are more than 55 feet tall is 10 feet from a side or rear \nlot line that is not a street lot line, and 5 feet from a side or rear lot line that is a \nstreet lot line.   \n2. Eastern Pattern Area minimum rear building setback. \na. Minimum rear building setback. In the RM1, RM2, RM3 and RM4 zones in the \nEastern Pattern Area the required minimum rear building setback is an amount \nequal to 25 percent of the total depth of the site. No more than 50 percent of the \nEastern Pattern Area rear setback can be vehicle area. The Eastern Pattern Area \nis shown on Map 120-3. \nb. Exemptions. The following are exempt from the Eastern Pattern Area minimum \nrear building setback. When a site is exempt from the Eastern Pattern Area \nminimum rear building setback, the base zone required minimum rear building \nsetback stated in Table 120-4 applies: \n(1) Corner lots and lots that are up to 100 feet deep are exempt from the \nEastern Pattern Area minimum rear building setback; and   \n(2) Sites where at least 10 percent of the total site area is outdoor common \narea and the common areas measure at least 30 feet in all directions are \nexempt from the Eastern Pattern Area minimum rear setback. \n(3)  Cottage clusters allowed under section 33.120.270.G. \n3. Exceptions to the required building setbacks.  \na. Setback matching. The minimum front and side street building setbacks and the \nsetback of decks, balconies, and porches may be reduced to match the setback \non an abutting lot.  \nb. Raised ground floor. In the RM2 and RM3 zones the minimum front building \nsetback may be reduced to 5 feet, and in the RM4 zone the minimum front and \nside street building setbacks may be reduced to zero feet, for buildings where \nthe finished floor of ground floor residential units is between 2 feet and 5 feet   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-24 \n \nabove the grade of the closest adjoining sidewalk. This exception does not apply \nin the Eastern Pattern Area shown on Map 120-3. \nc. Courtyard. Except in the Eastern Pattern Area shown on Map 120-3, the required \nminimum front or side street setback may be reduced to zero in the RM2 and \nRM3 zones, and may be reduced to 5 feet in the RM1 zone when: \n(1) At least 20 feet or 25 percent of the length of the street-facing building \nfacade, whichever is greater, is setback at least 40 feet from the street lot \nline; \n(2) At least half of the area between the setback portion of the building and the \nstreet lot line is landscaped to at least the L1 standard and the setback \nincludes no vehicle area; and  \n(3) The finished floor of the ground floor is between 2 feet and 5 feet above the \ngrade of the closest abutting sidewalk.   \nd. Ground floor commercial. The required minimum front or side street setbacks \nmay be reduced to zero in the RM2, RM3 and RM4 zones when the ground floor \nincludes a commercial use and at least 50 percent of the length of the ground-\nfloor street-facing façade is in a commercial use or is an indoor common area, \nsuch as an indoor recreation facility or community room. This exception does not \napply in the Eastern Pattern Area shown on Map 120-3. \ne. Environmental zone. The required minimum front and street building setback \nand garage entrance setback may be reduced to zero where any portion of the \nsite is in an environmental overlay zone. Where a side lot line is also a street lot \nline the side building and garage entrance setback may be reduced to zero. All \nother provisions of this Title apply to the building and garage entrance.  \nf. Split zoning. No setbacks are required from an internal lot line that is also a \nzoning line on sites with split zoning. \ng. Alley. No side or rear building setback is required from a lot line abutting  \nan alley. \nh. Land divisions with existing development. When a dedication of public right-of-\nway along the frontage of an existing street is required as part of a land division, \nthe minimum front or side setback between an existing building and a lot line \nthat abuts the right-of-way may be reduced to zero. Eaves on an existing building \nmay extend one foot into the reduced setback, except that they may not extend \ninto the right-of-way. Future additions or development must meet required \nminimum setbacks.  \ni. Eastern Pattern Area. In the Eastern Pattern Area, the footprint of buildings \ncontaining only indoor common area, such as recreational facilities or tenant \ncommunity rooms, may cover up to 25 percent of the Eastern Pattern Area \nminimum rear building setback. In this case, the building must be set back at \nleast 5 feet from the rear lot line.     \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-25 \n \nj. Inner Pattern Area. In the RM2, RM3, and RM4 zones in the Inner Pattern Area, \non sites that abut a Civic or Neighborhood Corridor shown on Map 120-1, no \nsetback is required from a lot line that abuts a property that also has a lot line on \na Civic or Neighborhood Corridor. See Figure 120-3. However, windows in the \nwalls of dwelling units must be setback a minimum of 5 feet from a lot line that \nabuts another property and this setback area must be a minimum width of 12 \nfeet or the width of the residential window, whichever is greater. \nFigure 120-3 \nNo setbacks between properties on Civic or Neighborhood Corridors \n \nC. Maximum building setbacks. \n1. Maximum building setbacks on a transit street or in a Pedestrian District. The required \nmaximum building setbacks, if any, are stated in Table 120-4, and apply only to \nbuildings that are enclosed on all sides. The maximum building setbacks on a transit \nstreet or in a Pedestrian District are as follows. At least 50 percent of the length of the \nground level street-facing façade of the building must meet the maximum building \nsetback standard: \na. Applying the standard. \n(1) Where an existing building is being altered, the standards apply to the \nground level, street-facing facade of the entire building. See Figures 120-4 \nand 120-5. \n(2) Where there is more than one building on the site, the standards of this \nparagraph apply to the combined ground level, street-facing facades of all \nthe buildings. See Figures 120-6 and 120-7. \n(3) For buildings where all of the floor area is in residential use, the street-\nfacing facade of an open porch that meets the following standards is \nincluded as part of the ground level, street-facing facade of the building:   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-26 \n \n• For houses, attached houses, manufactured homes and duplexes, the \nporch must be at least 25 square feet in area. For multi-dwelling \nstructures, the porch must be at least 9 feet wide and 7 feet deep; \n• The porch must have at least one entrance facing the street; and \n• The porch must have a roof that is: \n− No more than 12 feet above the floor of the porch; and \n− At least 30 percent solid. This standard may be met by having 30 \npercent of the porch area covered with a solid roof, or by having \nthe entire area covered with a trellis or other open material if no \nmore than 70 percent of the area of the material is open. \nb. Outside a Pedestrian District. Where the site is not in a Pedestrian District: \n(1) One transit street. Where the site is adjacent to one transit street, the \nstandard must be met on the transit street frontage; \n(2) Two non-intersecting transit streets. Where the site is adjacent to two \ntransit streets that do not intersect: \n• The standard must be met on the frontage of the street with the highest \ntransit classification. If both streets have the same highest classification, \nthe applicant may choose on which street to meet the standard; \n• If one of the transit streets intersects a City Walkway, the standard must \nbe met along both the street with the highest transit classification and \nthe City Walkway; \n(3) Two or more intersecting transit streets. Where the site is adjacent to two \nor more intersecting transit streets, the standard must be met on the  \nfrontages of the two streets with the highest transit classifications. If more \nthan two streets have the same highest transit classification, the applicant \nmay choose on which two streets to meet the standard; \nc. In a Pedestrian District. Where the site is in a Pedestrian District, the maximum \nbuilding setback standard applies to all street frontages, with the following \nexceptions: \n(1) Through lots. If the site is a through lot, the maximum setback standard only \napplies to the street with the highest transit street classification. If multiple \nstreets have the same highest transit street classification, the applicant may \nchoose on which street to apply the standard.  \n(2) Three or more street frontages. If the site has street lot lines on three or \nmore streets, the maximum setback standard only applies to two of the \nstreets. When this occurs, the standard must be applied to the streets with \nthe highest transit street classifications. If multiple streets have the same \nhighest transit street classification, the applicant may choose on which \nstreets to apply the standard.   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-27 \n \nFigure 120-4 \nAlteration to Existing Building in Conformance with Maximum Setback Standard \n \nFigure 120-5 \nAlterations to Existing Building \n   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-28 \n \nFigure 120-6 \nCalculating Maximum Building Setback When More Than One Building On Site \n \nFigure 120-7 \nNew Buildings On Sites With Buildings That Do Not Meet The Maximum Building Setback \n \n \n \n   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-29 \n \n2. Exemptions. \na. Flag lots. Flag lots are exempt from the maximum setback standards of this \nsection. \nb. Detached accessory structures. Detached accessory structures are exempt from \nthe maximum setback standards of this section. The street-facing facades of \ndetached accessory structures do not count towards meeting maximum setback \nstandards. See Figure 120-6. \nD. Extensions into required building setbacks.  \n1. The following features of a building may extend into a required building setback up to \n20 percent of the depth of the setback, except as indicated. However, the feature \nmust be at least 3 feet from a lot line, except as allowed in 33.120.270, Alternative \nDevelopment Options: \na. Chimneys, fireplace inserts and vents, mechanical equipment, and fire escapes; \nb. Wheelchair ramps, water collection cisterns and stormwater planters that do not \nmeet the standards of Paragraph D.4; \nc. Decks, stairways, and uncovered balconies that do not meet the standard for \nParagraph D.4, but only along a street lot line; and \nd. Bays and bay windows but only along a street lot line and must meet the \nfollowing requirements: \n(1) Each bay and bay window may be up to 12 feet long, but the total area of all \nbays and bay windows on a building facade cannot be more than 30 percent \nof the area of the facade; \n(2) At least 30 percent of the area of the bay which faces the property line \nrequiring the setback must be glazing or glass block; and \n(3) Bays and bay windows must cantilever beyond the foundation of the \nbuilding. \n2. Building eaves may project up to 2 feet into a required setback, provided the eave is at \nleast 3 feet from a lot line. \n3. Canopies and awnings may extend up to 5 feet into a required setback along a street \nlot line. \n4. The following minor features may extend into entire required building setbacks: \na. Utility connections attached to the building that are required to provide services, \nsuch as water electricity and other similar utility services; \nb. Gutters and downspouts that drain stormwater off a roof of the structure; \nc. Stormwater planters that are no more than 2-1/2 feet above the ground; \nd. Water collection cisterns that are 6 feet or less in height;   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-30 \n \ne. Attached decks, stairs, and ramps that are no more than 2-1/2 feet above the \nground. However, stairways and wheelchair ramps that lead to one entrance on \nthe street-facing facade of a building are allowed to extend into the required \nstreet setbacks regardless of height above ground; and \nf. On lots that slope down from the street, vehicular or pedestrian entry bridges \nthat are no more than 2-1/2 feet above the average sidewalk elevation.  \n5. Detached accessory structures. The setback standards for detached accessory \nstructures including detached mechanical equipment are stated in 33.120.280 below. \nFences are addressed in 33.120.285, below. Detached accessory dwelling units are \naddressed in Chapter 33.205.  \nE. Garage entrance and structured parking setback.  \n1. Garage entrance setback. The garage entrance setback is stated in Table 120-4. See \nChapter 33.910, Definitions, for a description. The walls of the garage structure are \nsubject to 33.120.283 and the applicable front, side, or rear building setbacks. \na. In the RM2, RM3, RM4, and RX zone, the garage entrance must be either 5 feet \nor closer to the street lot line, or 18 feet or farther from the street lot line. If the \ngarage entrance is located within 5 feet of the front lot line, it may not be closer \nto the lot line than the facade of the residential portion of the building. \nb. Exceptions. No setback is required from a lot line abutting an alley. However, the \nBureau of Transportation may require the garage entrance to be set back to \nensure adequate turning radius into the garage. \n2. Setbacks for structured parking. Structured parking that allows exiting in a forward \nmotion is subject to the setback requirements for buildings. Structured parking that \ndoes not allow exiting in a forward motion is subject to the garage entrance setback \nstandard stated in Table 120-4. \n33.120.225 Building Coverage \nA. Purpose. The building coverage standards, along with the height and setback standards, \nlimit the overall bulk of structures. They assure that larger buildings will not have a \nfootprint that overwhelms adjacent development. The standards help define the character \nof the different zones by determining how built-up a neighborhood appears.  \nB. Maximum building coverage. The maximum building coverages for all covered structures \non the site are stated in Table 120-4. In the RM2 zone, maximum building coverage on sites \nthat abut a Civic Corridor or Neighborhood Corridor shown on Map 120-1 is 70 percent of \nsite area. Maximum building coverage on all other RM2 sites is 60 percent of site area.  \nC. Exception. Structured parking that is no more than 6 feet above grade at any point, except \nas indicated below, does not count toward building coverage if the structured parking does \nnot have floor area above it, and the structured parking is covered by landscaping or an \noutdoor common area. Vehicle or pedestrian access into the structured parking is exempt \nfrom the calculation of grade, if the access is no more than 20 feet wide.   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-31 \n \n33.120.230 Building Length and Façade Articulation \nA. Purpose. These standards, along with the height and setback standard, limit the bulk of \nbuildings close to the street. These standards help ensure that large buildings will be \ndivided into smaller components that relate to the scale and development patterns of \nPortland’s multi-dwelling residential areas and add visual interest and variety to the street \nenvironment. \nB. Maximum building length. In the RM1, RM2, and RMP zones, the maximum building length \nfor the portion of buildings located within 30 feet of a street lot line is 100 feet. The \nportions of buildings subject to this standard must be separated by a minimum of 10 feet. \nSee Figure 120-8. Manufactured dwelling parks are exempt from this standard. \nFigure 120-8 \nMaximum Building Length \n \n \nC. Facade articulation \n1. Where the standard applies. This standard applies in the RM2 through RM4 zones as \nfollows. Development that includes a residential use is exempt from this standard until \nJanuary 1, 2029: \na.  In the RM2 zone, the standard applies to buildings more than 35 feet high that \nhave facade areas of more than 3,500 square feet within 20 feet of a street \nproperty line.  \nb.  In the RM3 and RM4 zones, the standard applies to buildings more than 45 feet \nhigh that have facade areas of more than 4,500 square feet within 20 feet of a \nstreet property line.  \nc. Portions of building facades that are vertically separated by a gap of at least 10 \nfeet in width extending at least 30 feet in depth from the street property line are   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-32 \n \nconsidered to be separate facades areas for the purposes of the facade area \nmeasurements. See Figure 120-8. \n2.  The standard. At least 25 percent of the area of a street-facing facade within 20 feet of \na street lot line must be divided into facade planes that are off-set by at least 2 feet in \ndepth from the rest of the facade. Facade area used to meet the facade articulation \nstandard may be recessed behind, or project out from, the primary facade plane, but \nprojections into street right-of-way, and balconies that do not count toward floor area \ndo not count toward meeting this standard. See Figure 120-9. \nFigure 120-9 \nFacade Articulation  \n \n33.120.231 Main Entrances \nA. Purpose. The main entrance standards: \n• Together with the window and garage standards, ensure that there is a physical and \nvisual connection between the living area of the residence and the street;  \n• Enhance public safety for residents and visitors and provide opportunities for \ncommunity interaction;  \n• Ensure that the pedestrian entrance is visible or clearly identifiable from the street by \nits orientation or articulation; and \n• Ensure a connection to the public realm for development on lots fronting both private \nand public streets by making the pedestrian entrance visible or clearly identifiable from \nthe public street.  \nB. Where these standards apply.  \n1. The standards of this section apply to all residential structure types in the multi-\ndwelling zones except for accessory dwelling units, manufactured dwelling parks, and \nhouseboat moorages. For multi-dwelling development, the standards apply only to \nresidential structures that are located within 40 feet of a street lot line.  \n2. Where a proposal is for an alteration or addition to existing development, the \nstandards apply only to the portion being altered or added.  \n3. On sites with frontage on both a private street and a public street, the standards apply \nto the site frontage on the public street. On all other sites with more than one street \nfrontage, the standards apply to the transit street. If there is no transit street, the \napplicant may choose on which frontage to meet the standards. If there is more than   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-33 \n \none transit street, the standards apply to the street with the highest transit street \nclassification. If all streets have the same transit street classification, the applicant \nmay choose on which frontage to meet the standards. \n4. Development on flag lots or on lots that slope up or down from the street with an \naverage slope of 20 percent or more are exempt from these standards.  \n5. Subdivisions and PUDs that received preliminary plan approval between September 9, \n1990, and September 9, 1995, are exempt from this standard. \n6. Development on lots where any portion of the lot is in a combined flood hazard area is \nexempt from the standard in Subsection D. \nC. Main entrance.  \n1. Standard. At least one main entrance for each structure must: \na. Be within 8 feet of the longest street-facing wall of the structure; and \nb. Either: \n(1) Face the street. See Figure 120-10; \n(2) Be at an angle of up to 45 degrees from the street; or \n(3) Open onto a porch. See Figure 120-11. The porch must: \n• Be at least 25 square feet in area; \n• Have at least one entrance facing the street; and \n• Have a roof that is: \n− No more than 12 feet above the floor of the porch; and \n− At least 30 percent solid. This standard may be met by having 30 \npercent of the porch area covered with a solid roof, or by having \nthe entire area covered with a trellis or other open material if no \nmore than 70 percent of the area of the material is open.  \n2. Alternative for multi-dwelling structures. As an alternative to Paragraph C.1, an \nentrance to a multi-dwelling structure may face a courtyard if the courtyard-facing \nentrance is located within 60 feet of a street and the courtyard meets the following \nstandards: \na. The courtyard must be at least 15 feet in width; \nb. The courtyard must abut a street; and  \nc. The courtyard must be landscaped to at least the L1 level, or hard-surfaced for \nuse by pedestrians. \nD. Distance from grade. For houses, attached houses, manufactured homes, duplexes, \ntriplexes, and fourplexes, the main entrance that meets Paragraph C.1 must be within 4 \nfeet of grade. For the purposes of this Subsection, grade is the average grade measured at \nthe outer most corners of the street facing facade. See Figure 120-12.   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-34 \n \nFigure 120-10 \nMain Entrance Facing the Street \n \nFigure 120-11 \nMain Entrance Opening Onto a Porch \n   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-35 \n \nFigure 120-12 \nCalculation of Grade: (Elevation A + Elevation B) / 2  \n \n33.120.232 Street-Facing Facades \nA. Purpose. The standards: \n• Work with the main entrance and garage standards to ensure that there is a visual \nconnection between the living area of the residence and the street; \n• Enhance public safety by allowing people to survey their neighborhood from inside \ntheir residences; and \n• Provide a pleasant pedestrian environment by preventing large expanses of blank \nfacades along streets.  \nB. Where these standards apply.  \n1. The standards of this section apply to the street-facing facades of all residential \nstructure types except for accessory dwelling units, manufactured dwelling parks, and \nhouseboat moorages. The standards of this section also do not apply in the RMP zone.  \n2.  Where a proposal is for an alteration or addition to existing development, the \napplicant may choose to apply the standard either to the portion being altered or \nadded, or to the entire street-facing facade. For a residential building with up to 4 \nunits, the side wall of a dormer is exempt from this standard. \n3. Development on flag lots, and development on lots that slope up or down from the \nstreet with an average slope of 20 percent or more, is exempt from these standards.  \n4. Subdivisions and PUDs that received preliminary plan approval between September 9, \n1990, and September 9, 1995, are exempt from Subsection C.  \n5. For structures subject to ground floor window standard in Subsection D, windows \nused to meet the ground floor window standard may also be used to meet the \nrequirements of Subsection C.   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-36 \n \nC. Windows. At least 15 percent of the area of each facade that faces a street lot line must be \nwindows or main entrance doors. Windows used to meet this standard must allow views \nfrom the building to the street. Glass block does not meet this standard. Windows in \ngarage doors do not count toward meeting this standard, but windows in garage walls do \ncount toward meeting this standard. To count toward meeting this standard a door must \nbe at the main entrance and facing the street property line. Development on flag lots or on \nlots which slope up or down from the street with an average slope of 20 percent or more \nare exempt from these standards. \nD. Ground floor windows. The following ground floor window standards apply to the portion \nof a building with ground floor commercial uses. For the purposes of this Paragraph, \nground floor wall area includes exterior wall area from 2 feet to 10 feet above the finished \ngrade. Required ground floor windows must be windows in walls or entrances that allow \nviews into working area or display windows that are at least 24 inches deep set into a wall. \nThe bottom of qualifying windows must be no more than 4 feet above the adjacent \nexterior grade: \n1. Windows must cover at least 40 percent of the ground floor wall area of the portion of \na building that has a ground floor commercial use when the ground floor wall is \nlocated closer than 5 feet from a street lot line.  \n2. Windows must cover at least 25 percent of the ground floor wall area of the portion of \nbuilding that has a ground floor commercial use when the ground floor wall is located \n5 feet or more from a street lot line. \n33.120.235 Landscaped Areas  \nA. Purpose. The standards for landscaped areas are intended to enhance the overall \nappearance of residential developments and institutional campuses in multi-dwelling \nzones. The landscaping improves the residential character of the area, breaks up large \nexpanses of paved areas and structures, provides privacy to the residents, and provides \nseparation from streets. Landscaping also helps cool the air temperature, intercept rainfall \nand reduce stormwater run-off by providing a non-paved permeable surface. Landscaping \ncan also provide food for people and habitat for birds and other wildlife. \nB. Minimum landscaped areas. The required amount of landscaped area is stated in Table \n120-4. Sites developed with a house, attached house, duplex, or manufactured dwelling \npark are exempt from this standard. Any required landscaping, such as for required \nsetbacks or parking lots, applies toward the minimum required landscaped area.  \n1. Except as allowed by Paragraph B.2., required landscaped areas must: \na. Be at ground level or in raised planters that are used to meet minimum Bureau of \nEnvironmental Services stormwater management requirements; and  \nb. Comply with at least the L1 standard described in Chapter 33.248, Landscaping \nand Screening. However, up to one-third of the required landscaped area may be \nimproved for active or passive recreational use or for use by pedestrians. \nExamples of active or passive recreational use include walkways, play areas, \nplazas, picnic areas, garden plots, and unenclosed recreational facilities.   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-37 \n \n2. Urban green alternative landscaped area. One or more of the following may be used \nto meet up to 50 percent of the required landscaped area: \na. Ecoroof. An ecoroof area may apply toward meeting the required landscaped \narea standard at a ratio of 4 square feet of ecoroof area for every 1 square foot \nof required landscaped area. The ecoroof area must be approved by the Bureau \nof Environmental Services as being in compliance with the Stormwater \nManagement Manual. \nb. Raised landscaped areas. Landscaped area raised above ground level may apply \ntoward meeting the minimum landscaped area standard when landscaped to at \nleast the L1 standard and soil depth is a minimum of 30 inches. Large trees are \nnot allowed in raised landscaped area used to meet this alternative. \nC. Additional landscaping standards. \n1. Building setbacks. The required building setbacks must be landscaped to at least the \nL1 standard of Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening. Ground-level pedestrian \npathways, detached accessory structures and other development allowed in the \nsetbacks are exempt from this standard except in the Eastern Pattern Area where \nallowed development can cover no more than 50 percent of the Eastern Pattern Area \nminimum rear setback area. Sites that are 10,000 square feet or less in total site area \nare also exempt from this standard. \n2. Parking areas. Perimeter and internal parking area landscaping standards are stated in \nChapter 33.266, Parking, Loading, and Transportation and Parking Demand \nManagement. \n33.120.237 Trees \nRequirements for street trees and for on-site tree preservation, protection, and overall tree density \nare specified in Title 11, Trees. See Chapter 11.50, Trees in Development Situations. \n33.120.240 Required Outdoor and Common Areas \nA. Purpose. The required outdoor and common area standards ensure opportunities for \noutdoor relaxation or recreation. The standards work with the building coverage and \nminimum landscaped areas standards to ensure that some of the land not covered by \nbuildings is of adequate size, shape, and location to be usable for outdoor recreation or \nrelaxation. The standards also ensure that outdoor areas are located so that residents have \nconvenient access. Required outdoor areas are an important aspect in addressing the \nlivability of a residential property by providing outdoor living opportunities, some options \nfor outdoor privacy, and a healthy environment. These standards also allow for common \narea requirements to be met by indoor community facilities because they also provide \nopportunities for recreation and gathering. \nB. Outdoor area and common area requirements. In the RM1 through RM4 zones, on sites \nwith a residential use, both outdoor and common areas are required. Required common \narea may count toward required outdoor area, but individual private outdoor area may not \ncount toward required common area. The standards of this section do not apply in the RX \nand RMP zones.   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-38 \n \n1. Required outdoor area. Outdoor area is required in the amounts stated below. \nOutdoor area may be provided as individual private outdoor area, such as a patio or \nbalcony, or may be provided as common area, such as outdoor courtyards, outdoor \nplay area, indoor recreational facilities, or indoor community rooms. There may be a \ncombination of individual or common areas. \na. RM1 and RM2 zones. In the RM1 and RM2 zones, at least 48 square feet of \noutdoor area is required per dwelling unit. \nb. RM3 and RM4 zones. In the RM3 and RM4 zones, on sites that are 20,000 square \nfeet or less in total area, at least 36 square feet of outdoor area is required per \ndwelling unit. In the RM3 and RM4 zones, on sites that are more than 20,000 \nsquare feet in total area, at least 48 square feet of outdoor area is required per \ndwelling unit. \n2. Required common area.  \na. Required common area standard. On sites that are more than 20,000 square feet \nin total site area, and on sites with a congregate housing facility, at least 10 \npercent of total site area must be provided as common area. At least 50 percent \nof the required common area must be outdoor area, such as outdoor courtyards \nor outdoor play areas. Up to 50 percent of the required common area may be \nindoor common area, such as indoor recreation facilities or indoor community \nrooms.  \nb. Exemption. The required common area standard does not apply to sites where: \n(1) All of the dwelling units have individual entrances that are within 20 feet of \na street lot line; \n(2) Each entrance is connected to the street by a path that is at least 3 feet \nwide and hard surfaced; and  \n(3) Each dwelling unit has at least 200 square feet of individual outdoor area \nwith a minimum dimension of 10 feet by 10 feet. \nC. Size, location and configuration.  \n1. Individual unit outdoor area. Where a separate outdoor area is provided for an \nindividual unit, it must be designed so that a 4-foot x 6-foot square will fit  \nentirely within it. The outdoor area must be directly accessible to the unit. Areas used \nfor pedestrian circulation to more than one dwelling unit do not count towards \nmeeting this standard of this subsection. If the area is at ground level, it may extend \ninto the entire required side and rear setback. Individual unit outdoor areas located at \nground level may also extend into the entire required street setback, but when \nlocated within a required street setback the outdoor area must either be at least 2 \nfeet above the grade of the closest adjoining sidewalk or separated from the street lot \nline by a minimum 3 foot setback landscaped to at least the L2 standard described in \nChapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening. Covered outdoor areas are subject to \nParagraph C.5 below. \n   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-39 \n \n2. Common areas.  \na. Outdoor common area. Where an outdoor, shared common area is provided, it \nmust be designed so that it is at least 500 square feet in area and must measure \nat least 20 feet in all directions. The outdoor common area must be located \nwithin 20 feet of a building entrance providing access to residential units. \nb. Indoor common area. Where an indoor common area is provided, it must be an \nindoor recreational facility or an indoor tenant community room. Indoor \ncommon areas that are not recreational facilities or community rooms, such as \nlobbies, hallways, laundry facilities, storage rooms, and vehicle or bicycle \nfacilities, cannot be used to meet this requirement. \nc. Combination of individual and common areas. Where a combination of individual \nunit and common areas is provided, each individual area must meet C.1 above \nand each common area must meet C.2.a or C.2.b above, providing an amount \nequivalent to the total required by Paragraph B.1 or B.2. \n3. Surfacing materials. Required outdoor areas must be surfaced with lawn, pavers, \ndecking, or sport court paving which allows the area to be used for active or passive \nrecreational use. \n4. User amenities. User amenities, such as tables, benches, trees, shrubs, planter boxes, \ngarden plots, drinking fountains, spas, or pools, may be placed in the outdoor area. \nCommon, shared outdoor areas may also be developed with amenities such as play \nareas, plazas, roof-top patios, picnic areas, and open recreational facilities. \n5. Enclosure. Outdoor areas used to meet the requirements of this section may be \ncovered, such as a covered patio, but they may not be fully enclosed. Covered outdoor \nareas are subject to the setback standards of this chapter. \n33.120.250 Screening \nA. Purpose. The screening standards address specific unsightly features which detract from \nthe appearance of multi-dwelling residential areas.  \nB. Garbage and recycling collection areas. All exterior garbage cans, garbage collection areas, \nand recycling collection areas must be screened from the street and any adjacent \nproperties. Trash receptacles for pedestrian use are exempt. Screening must comply with \nat least the L3 or F2 standards of Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening. \nC. Mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment located on the ground, such as heating or \ncooling equipment, pumps, or generators must be screened from the street and any \nabutting residential zones by walls, fences, or vegetation. Screening must comply with at \nleast the L2 or F2 standards of Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening, and be tall \nenough to screen the equipment. Mechanical equipment placed on roofs must be screened \nin one of the following ways, if the equipment is within 50 feet of an R zone: \n1. A parapet along facades facing the R zone that is as tall as the tallest part of  \nthe equipment;  \n2. A screen around the equipment that is as tall as the tallest part of the equipment; or   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-40 \n \n3. The equipment is set back from roof edges facing the R zone 3 feet for each foot of \nheight of the equipment. \nD. Other screening requirements. Outdoor seating associated with a Retail Sales And Service \nuse must be screened from any abutting residential zones by walls, fences or vegetation. \nScreening must comply with at least the L3 or F2 standards of Chapter 33.248, Landscaping \nand Screening. The screening requirements for parking, exterior storage, and exterior \ndisplay areas are stated with the regulations for those types of development. \n33.120.255 Pedestrian Standards  \nA. Purpose. The pedestrian standards encourage a safe, attractive, and usable pedestrian \ncirculation system in all developments. They ensure a direct pedestrian connection \nbetween abutting streets and buildings on the site, and between buildings and other \nactivities within the site. In addition, they provide for connections between adjacent sites, \nwhere feasible. The standards promote configurations that minimize conflicts between \npedestrians and vehicles. In order to facilitate additional pedestrian oriented space and less \nimpervious surface, the standards also provide opportunities for accessways with low \ntraffic volumes, serving a limited number of residential units, to be designed to \naccommodate pedestrians and vehicles within the same space when special paving \ntreatments are used to signify their intended use by pedestrians as well as vehicles. \nB. The standards. The standards of this section apply to all development except houses, \nattached houses, manufactured homes on individual lots, duplexes, and attached duplexes. \nThe standards of this section also do not apply to manufactured dwelling parks. An on-site \npedestrian circulation system must be provided. The system must meet all standards of this \nsubsection.  \n1. Connections. The on-site pedestrian circulation system must provide connections as \nspecified below: \na. Connection between streets and entrances.  \n(1) Sites with one street frontage.  \n• Generally. All primary buildings located within 40 feet of a street lot line \nmust have a connection between one main entrance and the adjacent \nstreet. The connection may not be more than 20 feet longer or 120 \npercent of the straight line distance, whichever is less.  \n• Tree preservation. If a tree that is at least 12 inches in diameter is \nproposed for preservation, and the location of the tree or its root \nprotection zone would prevent the standard of this paragraph from \nbeing met, the connection may be up to 200 percent of the straight  \nline distance.  \n(2) Sites with more than one street frontage. Where the site has more than one \nstreet frontage, the following must be met: \n• The standard of B.1.a(1) must be met to connect the main entrance of \neach building located within 40 feet of a street lot line to the closest \nsidewalk or roadway if there are no sidewalks.  \n• An additional connection, which does not have to be a straight line \nconnection, is required between each of the other streets and a   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-41 \n \npedestrian entrance. However, if at least 50 percent of a street facing \nfacade is within 10 feet of the street, no connection is required to  \nthat street. \nb. Internal connections. On sites larger than 10,000 square feet, an internal \npedestrian connection system must be provided. The system must connect all \nmain entrances on the site that are more than 20 feet from the street, and \nprovide connections to other areas of the site, such as parking areas, bicycle \nparking, recreational areas, common outdoor areas, and any  \npedestrian amenities. \n2. Materials.  \na. The circulation system required by the standards of this section must be hard-\nsurfaced and must meet the following minimum width requirements: \n(1)  The circulation system on sites with up to 4 residential units must be at least \n3 feet wide. \n(2) The circulation system on sites with 5 to 20 units must be at least 4 feet \nwide. \n(3) The circulation system on sites with more than 20 residential units must be \nat least 5 feet wide. \n(4) Segments of the circulation system that connect only to an entrance \nproviding access to up to 4 units may be 3 feet wide. \nb. Except as allowed in subparagraph d, below, where the system crosses \ndriveways, parking areas, and loading areas, the system must be clearly \nidentifiable, through the use of elevation changes, speed bumps, a different \npaving material, or other similar method. Striping does not meet this \nrequirement. Elevation changes and speed bumps must be at least 4 inches high. \nc. Except as allowed in subparagraph d, below, where the system is parallel and \nadjacent to an auto travel lane, the system must be a raised path or be separated \nfrom the auto travel lane by a raised curb, bollards, landscaping or other physical \nbarrier. If a raised path is used it must be at least 4 inches high and the ends of \nthe raised portions must be equipped with curb ramps. Bollard spacing must be \nno further apart than 5 feet on center. \nd. The pedestrian circulation system may be within an auto travel lane if the auto \ntravel lane provides access to 16 or fewer parking spaces and the entire auto \ntravel lane is surfaced with paving blocks or bricks. \n3. Lighting. The on-site pedestrian circulation system must be lighted to a level where \nthe system can be used at night by the employees, residents, and customers. \n33.120.260 Recycling Areas \nRequirements for recycling areas are regulated by the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability. See \nSection 17.102.270, Businesses and Multifamily Complexes Required to Recycle, of the Portland  \nCity Code.   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-42 \n \n33.120.270 Alternative Development Options \nA. Purpose. The alternative development options provide increased variety in development \nwhile maintaining the residential neighborhood character. The options are intended to: \n• Accommodate a diversity of housing types and tenures; \n• Encourage development which is more sensitive to the environment, especially in  \nhilly areas; \n• Encourage the preservation of open and natural areas; \n• Promote better site layout and adequate opportunities for private or common \nrecreation and open areas; \n• They promote a visual connection between the residences and the common open \nareas; \n• Allow for greater flexibility within a development site while limiting impacts to the \nsurrounding neighborhood; \n• Promote more opportunities for affordable housing;  \n• Allow more energy-efficient development; and \n• Reduce the impact that new development may have on surrounding  \nresidential development. \nB. General requirements for all alternative development options. The alternative \ndevelopment options listed in this section are allowed by right unless it is specifically stated \notherwise. They must conform with all other development standards of the base zone \nunless those standards are superseded by the ones in this section. Sites in the RMP zone \nare not eligible for alternative development option. \nC. Attached houses. The development standards for attached housing are: \n1. Density, height, and other development standards. The minimum density, height, \nbuilding length, landscaped areas, required outdoor area, and window requirements \nof the base zone apply. \n2. Lot size. See 33.612, Lots in Multi-Dwelling Zones, for lot size information. \n3. Building setbacks. The side building setback on the side containing the common or \nabutting wall is reduced to zero. The reduced setback applies to all buildings on the lot \nand extends along the full length of the lot line that contains the common or abutting \nwall. \n4. Building coverage. The maximum building coverage of the base zone applies to the \nentire attached housing project, however the maximum building coverage for an \nindividual lot may not exceed 5 percent more than the base zone allowance. \n5. Maximum building length. The maximum building length standard stated in Table 120-\n4 applies to the combined length of the street-facing facades of each unit. \nD. Reduced setbacks for detached houses. For land divisions that include lots created for \ndetached houses, where the lots are at least 25 feet wide, the detached houses may have \ntheir side setbacks reduced to 3 feet on lot lines internal to the land division site. The \nreduced side setbacks must be shown on the land division Preliminary Plan. Eaves may   \nTitle 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.120 \n3/1/25 Multi-Dwelling Zones \n120-43 \n \nproject up to one foot into the reduced side setback. All building setbacks around the \nperimeter of the land division site are those of the base zone. \nE. Attached duplexes. The attached duplex regulations allow for an alternative housing type \nthat promotes owner-occupied structures, the efficient use of land, and for energy-\nconserving housing. \n1. Lot size. Each attached duplex must be on a lot that complies with the lot size \nstandard for new lots of the base zone. \n2. Building setbacks. The side building setback on the side containing the common wall is \nreduced to zero.  \n3. Number of units. A maximum of 2 units per lot and 4 units per structure is allowed. \nF. Cottage cluster. Cottage clusters that meet the following standards are allowed in the RM1 \nzone. Cottage clusters are prohibited on sites that do not have frontage on a maintained \nstreet, except sites that have frontage on a private street that connects to a maintained \nstreet, and sites that have frontage on a self-contained pedestrian connection created \nsolely for pedestrians and bicycles that connects to a maintained street. Payment in lieu of \nstreet improvements does not satisfy this requirement. Except as allowed below, \nadjustments to the following standards are prohibited.  \n1. Minimum site dimensions. Adjustments to reduce the minimum required site \ndimensions by up to 10 percent may be requested prior to January 2, 2032. Beginning \nJanuary 2, 2032, adjustments are prohibited. \na. Minimum site area. Cottages cluster sites must be at least 5,000 square feet in \narea. \nb. Minimum site width. Cottage cluster sites must be at least 36 feet wide. Site \nwidth for a cottage cluster is measured as lot width is measured. See 33.930.100. \n2. Maximum area.

Beginning January 2, 2032, adjustments are \nprohibited. \n3. Maximum dwelling units. The maximum number of dwelling units allowed on a \ncottage cluster site is 16. Adjustments to this standard may be requested prior to \nJanuary 2, 2032. Beginning January 2, 2032, adjustments are prohibited. \n4. Floor area. Cottage clusters are exempt from 33.120.210, Floor Area Ratio. However, \nthe maximum average floor area for all dwelling units on the cottage cluster site is \n1,400 square feet, including the floor area for attached accessory structures. The \napplicant may choose to exclude the floor area of any existing dwelling units that \nreceived final inspection at least 5 years ago from the average. The maximum floor \narea allowed for a detached accessory structure is 400 square feet.  \n5. Maximum height. The maximum height allowed is 25 feet. Existing dwelling units that \nthat received final inspection at least 5 years ago exceed this maximum height are   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-44 \n \nallowed but the height cannot be increased. The maximum height standards for \ndetached accessory structures are stated in 33.120.280, Detached Accessory \nStructures.  \n6. Separation. Dwelling units within the cottage cluster site must be separated by 6 feet.  \n7. Building coverage. Cottage clusters are exempt from 33.120.225. Building Coverage. \nThe following building coverage standards apply: \na.

Planned Development. See Chapter 33.270, Planned Development. \n33.120.275 Development Standards for Institutions \nA. Purpose. The general base zone development standards in the multi-dwelling zones are \ndesigned for residential buildings. Different development standards are needed for \ninstitutional uses which may be allowed in multi-dwelling zones. The intent is to maintain \ncompatibility with and limit the negative impacts on surrounding residential areas. \nB. Use categories to which these standards apply. Except for Daycare uses, the standards of \nthis section apply to uses in the institutional group of use categories in the multi-dwelling \nzones, whether allowed by right, allowed with limitations, or subject to a conditional use \nreview. Daycare uses are subject to the regular base zone development standards. The \nstandards of this section apply to new development, exterior alterations, and conversions \nto institutional uses. Recreational fields used for organized sports on a school, school site, \nor in a park, are subject to the regulations of Chapter 33.279, Recreational Fields for \nOrganized Sports.  \nC. The standards.  \n1. The development standards are stated in Table 120-8. If not addressed in this section, \nthe regular base zone development standards apply. \n2.

Electrified fences are regulated under Title 26, Electrical \nRegulations. The use of barbed wire is regulated under Title 24, Building Regulations. \n33.120.290 Demolitions \nA. Generally. Demolition on a site that requires a demolition permit is subject to the tree \npreservation and protection requirements of Title 11, Trees. See Chapter 11.50, Trees in \nDevelopment Situations. \nB. Historic resources. Demolition of historic resources is regulated by Chapter 33.445, Historic \nResource Overlay Zone. \n33.120.300 Nonconforming Development \nExisting developments that do not conform to the development standards of this chapter may be \nsubject to the regulations of Chapter 33.258, Nonconforming Situations. \n33.120.305 Parking, Loading, and Transportation and Parking Demand Management \nThe regulations for vehicle parking, bicycle parking, loading, and transportation and parking demand \nmanagement are stated in Chapter 33.266, Parking, Loading, and Transportation and Parking \nDemand Management. \n33.120.310 Signs \nThe sign regulations are stated in Title 32, Signs and Related Regulations.   \nChapter 33.120 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMulti-Dwelling Zones 3/1/25 \n120-62 \n \n33.120.320 Inclusionary Housing \nThe regulations pertaining to inclusionary housing are stated in Chapter 33.245,  \nInclusionary Housing. \n33.120.330 Street and Pedestrian Connections \nA. Large site pedestrian connectivity.  \n1. Purpose. The large site pedestrian connectivity standard implements regional \npedestrian and bicycle connectivity standards. The standard enhances direct \nmovement by pedestrians and bicycles between destinations and increases the \nconvenience of travelling by foot or bike. The standard also protects public health and \nsafety by ensuring safe movement and access through a large site. The standard \nprovides flexibility for locating the pedestrian connection in a manner that addresses \nsite constraints such as existing development. \n2. When does the standard apply. The large site pedestrian connectivity standard applies \nto new development and major remodeling on sites that are more than 5 acres in size. \n3. Standard. If the site does not have pedestrian connections at least every 330 feet as \nmeasured from the centerline of each connection, then dedication of right-of-way for \npedestrian connections is required. \n4. Exemptions. Dedication of right-of-way for pedestrian connections is not required in: \na. The Central City plan district; and  \nb. Areas of a site that are in the Environmental Protection overlay zone, the \nEnvironmental Conservation overlay zone, or have slopes with an average slope \nof 20 percent or greater. This means that if the 330 feet interval falls in one of \nthese areas, that pedestrian connection is not required. \n5. Pedestrian connection alignment, width and design. The Bureau of Transportation \nmust approve the alignment of the pedestrian connections. The final alignment must \nensure that pedestrian connections are located at least 200 feet apart. The Bureau of \nTransportation must also approve the width of, and configuration of elements within, \nthe pedestrian connections. \nB. Additional requirements for street and pedestrian/bicycle connections are regulated by the \nBureau of Transportation.

These zones implement the vision, guiding principles, \nand goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, and encourage economic prosperity, human \nhealth, environmental health, equity, and resilience. These zones are primarily distinguished by the \nuses allowed and the intensity of development allowed. The zones allow a mix of commercial \nactivities, housing, and employment uses that reflect the different types of centers and corridors \ndescribed in the Urban Design chapter of the Comprehensive Plan, and also accommodate smaller, \ndispersed commercial and mixed use areas to provide opportunities for services in areas between \nthe centers and corridors.  \nThe commercial/mixed use zones are intended to serve local neighborhood areas, larger districts, as \nwell as broader citywide or regional markets. The regulations promote uses and development that \nsupport healthy complete neighborhoods—places where people of all ages and abilities have safe \nand convenient access to the goods and services they need in their daily life, and where people have \nthe opportunity to live active lifestyles. The zones encourage quality and innovative design, and \nfacilitate creation of great places and great streets. \nThe development standards are designed to allow development flexibility, within parameters, that \nsupports the intended characteristics of the specific zone. In addition, the regulations provide \nguidance to property owners, developers, and neighbors about the limits of what is allowed. \n33.130.020 List of the Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \nThe full and short names of the commercial/mixed use zones and their map symbols are listed \nbelow. When this Title refers to the commercial/mixed use zones, it is referring to the zones listed \nhere.  \nFull Name Short Name / Map Symbol \nCommercial Residential CR \nCommercial/Mixed Use 1 CM1 \nCommercial/Mixed Use 2 CM2 \nCommercial/Mixed Use 3 CM3 \nCommercial Employment CE \nCentral Commercial CX \n33.130.030 Characteristics of the Zones \nA. Commercial Residential zone. The Commercial Residential (CR) zone is a low-intensity zone \nfor small and isolated sites in residential neighborhoods. The zone is intended to be applied \nin limited situations on local streets and neighborhood collectors in areas that are \npredominately zoned single-dwelling residential. The zone encourages the provision of \nsmall scale retail and service uses for surrounding residential areas. Uses are restricted in \nsize to promote a local orientation, and to limit adverse impacts on surrounding residential \nareas. Where commercial uses are not present, residential density is limited to provide  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n3/1/24 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-3 \ncompatibility with surrounding residential areas. Development is intended to be \npedestrian-oriented and building height is intended to be compatible with the scale of \nsurrounding residentially zoned areas. \nB. Commercial/Mixed Use 1 zone. The Commercial/Mixed Use 1 (CM1) zone is a small-scale \nzone intended for sites in dispersed mixed use nodes within lower density residential areas, \nas well as on neighborhood corridors and at the edges of neighborhood centers, town \ncenters and regional centers. The zone is also appropriate in core commercial areas of \ncenters in locations where older commercial storefront buildings of 1 to 2 stories are \npredominant. This zone allows a mix of commercial and residential uses. The size of \ncommercial uses is limited to minimize impacts on surrounding residential areas. Buildings \nin this zone will generally be up to three stories tall. Development is intended to be \npedestrian-oriented and compatible with the scale and characteristics of adjacent \nresidentially zoned areas or low-rise commercial areas. \nC. Commercial/Mixed Use 2 zone. The Commercial/Mixed Use 2 (CM2) zone is a medium-\nscale zone intended for sites in a variety of centers, along corridors, and in other mixed use \nareas that have frequent transit service. The zone allows a wide range and mix of \ncommercial and residential uses, as well as employment uses that have limited off-site \nimpacts. Buildings in this zone will generally be up to four stories tall unless height and \nfloor area bonuses are used, or plan district provisions specify other height limits. \nDevelopment is intended to be pedestrian-oriented, provide a strong relationship between \nbuildings and sidewalks, and complement the scale of surrounding residentially zoned \nareas. \nD. Commercial/Mixed Use 3 zone. The Commercial/Mixed Use 3 (CM3) zone is a large-scale \nzone intended for sites in high-capacity transit station areas, in town centers, along \nstreetcar alignments, along civic corridors, and in locations close to the Central City. It is \nintended to be an intensely urban zone and is not appropriate for sites where adjacent \nproperties have single-dwelling residential zoning. The zone allows a wide range and mix of \ncommercial and residential uses, as well as employment uses that have limited off-site \nimpacts. Buildings in this zone will generally be up to six stories tall unless height and floor \narea bonuses are used, or plan district provisions specify other height limits. Development \nis intended to be pedestrian-oriented, with buildings that contribute to an urban \nenvironment with a strong street edge of buildings. The scale of development is intended \nto be larger than what is allowed in lower intensity commercial/mixed use and residential \nzones. The Design overlay zone is applied to this zone. \nE. Commercial Employment zone. The Commercial Employment (CE) zone is a medium-scale \nzone intended for sites along corridors with a Neighborhood Collector or higher traffic \nclassification, especially along civic corridors that are also Major Truck Streets or Priority \nTruck Streets. This zone is generally not appropriate in designated centers, except on a site \nthat is currently developed in an auto-oriented manner and where more urban \ndevelopment is not yet economically feasible. The zone allows a mix of commercial uses, \nincluding auto-accommodating development and drive-through facilities, as well as some \nlight manufacturing and distribution uses that have few off-site impacts. The emphasis of \nthis zone is on commercial and employment uses, but residential uses are also allowed. \nBuildings in this zone will generally be up to four stories tall. This zone is intended to allow  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 3/1/24 \n130-4 \nfor development with auto-accommodating configurations, while also including pedestrian-\noriented design features that support transit and pedestrian access.  \nF. Central Commercial zone. The Central Commercial (CX) zone is intended to provide for \ncommercial and mixed use development within Portland's most urban and intense areas, \nspecifically the Central City and the Gateway Regional Center. A broad range of uses are \nallowed to reflect Portland's role as a commercial, cultural, residential, and governmental \ncenter. Development is intended to be very intense with high building coverage, large \nbuildings, and buildings placed close together. Development is intended to be pedestrian-\noriented with a strong emphasis on a safe and attractive streetscape. The Design overlay \nzone is applied to this zone. \n33.130.040 Other Zoning Regulations \nThe regulations in this chapter state the allowed uses and the development standards for the base \nzones. Sites with overlay zones, plan districts, or designated historical landmarks are subject to \nadditional regulations. The Official Zoning Maps indicate which sites are subject to the additional \nregulations. Specific uses or development types may also be subject to regulations in the 200s series \nof chapters. \n33.130.050 Neighborhood Contact \nNeighborhood contact is a set of outreach steps that must be taken before certain developments \ncan be submitted for approval. Neighborhood contact is required as follows: \nA. Neighborhood contact I. \n1. Neighborhood contact I requirements. When proposed development will add at least \n10,000 square feet and not more than 25,000 square feet of net building area to a \nsite, the neighborhood contact steps of 33.705.020.A., Neighborhood contact I, are \nrequired. All the steps in 33.705.020.A. must be completed before an application for a \nbuilding permit can be submitted. \n2. Exemption. If the proposed development has already met the neighborhood contact \nrequirements as part of a land use review process, it is exempt from the neighborhood \ncontact requirements.  \nB. Neighborhood contact II. \n1. Neighborhood contact II requirements. When the proposed development will add \nmore than 25,000 square feet of net building area to a site, the neighborhood contact \nsteps of 33.705.020.B., Neighborhood contact II, are required. All of the steps in \n33.705.020.B. must be completed before an application for a building permit can be \nsubmitted. \n2. Exemption. If the proposed development has already met the neighborhood contact \nrequirements as part of a land use review process, it is exempt from the neighborhood \ncontact requirements.

Agriculture in the CM3 and CE zones. This regulation applies to all parts of Table 130-1 \nthat have a [11]. Agriculture that is outdoors is a conditional use. Agriculture that is \nentirely indoors is allowed up to the following limits. Indoor Agriculture in excess of \nthe following limits is prohibited. Where the use and site meet the regulations of \nChapter 33.237, Food Production and Distribution, the applicant may choose whether \nit is allowed as a Market Garden, which does not require a conditional use: \na. In the CM3 zone, the total net building area of all indoor Agriculture per site may \nnot exceed the total square footage of the site; and \nb. In the CE zone, each indoor Agriculture use is limited to 40,000 square feet of net \nbuilding area. \nC. Conditional uses. Uses that are allowed if approved through the conditional use review \nprocess are listed in Table 130-1 with a \"CU\". These uses are allowed provided they comply \nwith the conditional use approval criteria for that use, the development standards, and \nother regulations of this Title. Uses listed with a \"CU\" that also have a footnote number in \nthe table are subject to the regulations cited in the footnote.

Purpose. Floor area ratios (FARs) regulate the amount of use (the intensity) allowed on a \nsite. FARs provide a means to match the potential amount of uses with the desired \ncharacter of the area and the provision of public services. FARs also work with the height, \nsetback, and building coverage standards to control the overall bulk of development. The \nbonus FAR options allow additional floor area as an incentive for providing  \naffordable housing. \nB. FAR standard. The maximum floor area ratios are stated in Table 130-2 and apply to all \nuses and development. Additional floor area may be allowed through bonus options, as \ndescribed in Section 33.130.212, or transferred from historic resources per Subsection C. \nAdjustments to the maximum floor area ratios are prohibited. Except in the CR zone, floor \narea does not include the following: \n1. Floor area for structured parking when at least 50 percent, or 6, of the parking spaces \nin the structure, whichever is greater, have at least a Level 2 charger adjacent to the \nspace, up to a maximum of 0.5 to 1; \n2. Floor area for required long term bicycle parking that is not located in a dwelling unit, \nup to a maximum of 0.5 to 1; and  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 1/1/25 \n130-10 \n3. Floor area for indoor common area used to meet the requirements of Section \n33.130.228. \nC. Transfer of floor area from historic resources. Floor area ratios may be transferred from a \nsite that contains a historic resource as follows:  \n1. Sending sites. FAR may be transferred from a site that contains a Historic or \nConservation Landmark or a contributing resource in a Historic or Conservation \nDistrict. Sites that are eligible to send floor area through this transfer are allowed to \ntransfer: \na. Unused FAR up to the maximum FAR allowed by the zone; and  \nb. An additional amount equivalent to 50 percent of the maximum FAR for the \nzone. To qualify to transfer this additional amount of FAR, Portland Permitting & \nDevelopment must verify that the landmark or contributing resource on the site \nmeets one of the following:  \n(1) If the building is classified as Risk category I or II, as defined in the Oregon \nStructural Specialty Code, it has been shown to meet or exceed the \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 41- BPOE improvement standard \nas defined in City of Portland Title 24.85; \n(2) If the building is classified as Risk category III or IV, as defined in the Oregon \nStructural Specialty Code, it has been shown to meet or exceed the ASCE41- \nBPON improvement standard as defined in City of Portland Title 24.85; or \n(3) The owner of the landmark or contributing resource has entered into a \nphased seismic agreement with the City of Portland as described in Section \n24.85. \n2. Receiving site. The transfer must be to a site that is zoned CM1, CM2, CM3, CE, CX, \nRM1, RM2, RM3, RM4, or RX outside of the Central City plan district. Transferring to a \nsite that is zoned CR is prohibited. Transferring to a site where a Historic or \nConservation Landmark or a contributing structure in a Historic or Conservation \nDistrict has been demolished within the past ten years is prohibited unless the \nlandmark or contributing structure was destroyed by fire or other causes beyond the \ncontrol of the owner, the only structure on the site that was demolished was an \naccessory structure, or the demolition was approved through demolition review. \n3.  Maximum increase in FAR in the CM1, CM2, CM3, and CE zones. In the CM1, CM2, \nCM3, and CE zones, the total FAR on the receiving site may not exceed the maximum \nFAR with bonuses identified on Table 130-3. This total FAR includes FAR transferred \nfrom historic resources, and any additional FAR allowed at the receiving site from \nbonus options, or from other transfers. In addition, an increase on the receiving site of \nmore than the following due to a historic resource transfer is prohibited: \na. 0.5 to 1 in the CM1 zone; \nb. 0.75 to 1 in the CM2 zone; \nc. 1 to 1 in the CM3 zone;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n3/1/24 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-11 \nd. 0.5 to 1 in the CE zone.  \n4. Maximum increase in FAR in the CX zone. In the CX zone, an increase in FAR on the \nreceiving site of more than 3 to 1 is prohibited. The total increased FAR includes FAR \ntransferred from historic resources, and additional FAR allowed at the receiving site \nfrom bonus provisions, or from other transfers; \n5. Development standards. The building on the receiving site must meet the \ndevelopment standards of the base zone, overlay zone, and plan district except floor \narea ratio, which is regulated by Paragraphs C.2 and C.3 above;  \n6. The property owner must execute a covenant with the City that is attached to and \nrecorded with the deed of both the site transferring and the site receiving the density. \nThe covenant must reflect the respective increase and decrease of potential FAR. The \ncovenants for both sites must meet the requirements of Section 33.700.060, \nCovenants with the City.  \n33.130.207 Minimum Density \nA. Purpose. The minimum density standards ensure that the service capacity is not wasted \nand that the City's housing goals are met. \nB. Minimum Density. The minimum density requirements for the CM2 and CM3 zones are \nstated in Table 130-2. Minimum density applies to new development when at least one \ndwelling unit is proposed. Group Living uses are exempt from minimum density \nrequirements. Land within an Environmental zone may be subtracted from the calculation \nof minimum density.  \n33.130.210 Height \nA. Purpose. The height limits are intended to control the overall scale of buildings. The height \nlimits in the CR and CM1 zones allow buildings that are in scale with low rise residential \nareas. The height limits in the CM2 and CE zones allow for a greater building height at a \nscale that can accommodate the growth intended for centers and corridors, while relating \nto the low- to mid-rise scale of neighborhood residential areas. The CM3 zone allows the \ntallest buildings outside the Central City and Gateway plan districts, consistent with its \nintended role in accommodating higher-density development in areas well served by \ntransit and other services. The CX zone allows the tallest buildings in the commercial/mixed \nuse zones, consistent with its intended role in accommodating high-density development in \nthe Central City and the Gateway plan districts.  \n In some situations, step downs in maximum height provide a transition in scale to adjacent \nlower-scale residential areas, and preserve opportunities for light, air and privacy. \nExceptions to height limit standards accommodate minor projections that do not \nsignificantly increase the visual scale of buildings; provide flexibility in the height of \nparapets and railings to facilitate rooftop outdoor spaces and equipment screening; and \naccommodate ground-floor spaces with high ceilings to encourage ground-floor \ncommercial uses, mechanical parking, and other uses that benefit from high ceilings. \n \n  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 3/1/24 \n130-12 \nB. Height standard.  \n1. Base height. The base height standards for all structures, except detached accessory \nstructures, are stated in Table 130-2. The height standards for detached accessory \nstructures are stated in 33.130.265, Detached Accessory Structures.  \n2. Step-down height. In the following situations, the base height is reduced, or stepped-\ndown. Stepped-down height is not required in the CR zone: \na. Step-down adjacent to residential zones. The following step-down height limits \napply within 25 feet of sites zoned residential. Sites with property lines that abut \nresidential zones for less than a 5-foot length are exempt from these standards: \n(1) On the portion of the site within 25 feet of a site zoned RF through R2.5, the \nstep-down height limit is 35 feet. See Figure 130-1.  \n(2) On the portion of the site within 25 feet of a site zoned RM1 or RMP, the \nstep-down height limit is 45 feet. See Figure 130-1.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n3/1/24 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-13 \nFigure 130-1 \nStep-Down Height Adjacent to Residential Zones \n \nb. Step-down across a local service street or alley from a residential zone. In the \nCM2, CM3, CX, and CE zones the following step-down height limit applies. The \nlimit does not apply to portions of buildings within 100 feet of a transit street. On \nthe portion of the site within 15 feet of a lot line that is across a local service \nstreet or alley from a site zoned RF through R2.5 or RM1 or RMP, the step-down \nheight limit is 45 feet. See Figure 130-2. \n3. Bonus height. The base height limits can be increased through options described in \nSection 33.130.212. When a bonus option allowed by 33.130.212 is used to increase \nthe base height, the step-down height limits do not increase. \nC. Exceptions. Exceptions to the base height, step-down height, and bonus height limits are \nstated below:  \n1. Projections allowed. Chimneys, vents, flag poles, satellite receiving dishes, and other \nsimilar items that are attached to a building and have a width, depth, or diameter of 5 \nfeet or less may extend 10 feet above the height limits, or 5 feet above the highest \npoint of the roof, whichever is greater. Items that are greater than 5 feet in width, \ndepth, or diameter are not allowed to project above the base, step-down, or bonus \nheight limits.   Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 3/1/24 \n130-14 \n2. Parapets and railings. In the CM1, CM2, CM3, CE and CX zones, parapets and rooftop \nrailings may extend 4 feet above the height limits. \n3. Walls and fences. In the CM1, CM2, CM3, CE and CX zones, walls or fences located \nbetween individual rooftop decks may extend 6 feet above the height limits if the \nvisual screen is set back at least 4 feet from the edges of the roof. \n4. Rooftop equipment. In the CM1, CM2, CM3, CE and CX zones, rooftop mechanical \nequipment and stairwell enclosures that provide rooftop access may extend above the \nheight limits as follows, provided that the equipment and enclosures are set back at \nleast 15 feet from all roof edges on street facing facades: \na. Elevator mechanical equipment and stairwell enclosures may extend up to 16 \nfeet above the height limits; and \nb. Other mechanical equipment that cumulatively cover no more than 10 percent of \nthe roof area may extend up to 10 feet above the height limits. \n5. Antennas and mounting devices, utility power poles, and public safety facilities are \nexempt from the height limits. \n6. Small wind turbines are subject to the standards of Chapter 33.299.  \n7. Roof mounted solar panels are not included in height calculations and may exceed the \nmaximum height limits if the following are met: \na. For flat roofs or the horizontal portion of mansard roofs, the solar panel may \nextend up to 5 feet above the top of the highest point of the roof; and \nb. For pitched, shed, hipped, or gambrel roofs, the solar panel must be mounted no \nmore than 12 inches from the surface of the roof at any point, and may not \nextend above the ridgeline of the roof. The 12 inches is measured from the upper \nside of the solar panel. \n8. High ceilings. In the CM1, CM2, CM3, CE and CX zones outside the Central City plan \ndistrict, base height, step-down height, and bonus height may be increased by 5 feet \nwhen at least 75 percent of the ground floor has at least 15 feet between the floor \nand the bottom of the structure above. The bottom of the structure above includes \nsupporting beams. This exception does not apply if any portion of the ground floor is \nmore than 2 feet above the existing or proposed sidewalk.

Purpose. The bonus options allow additional floor area and an increase in height as an \nincentive for development that provides a public or community benefit. The bonus can be \ngained in exchange for providing affordable housing or affordable commercial space in \nconjunction with new development.  \nB. General floor area and height bonus option regulations. \n1. Unless specified below, the bonus options in this section are allowed only in the CM1, \nCM2, CM3, and CE zones, and in the CX zone outside the Central City and Gateway \nplan districts. Sites where a Historic or Conservation Landmark or a contributing \nstructure in a Historic or Conservation District has been demolished within the past \nten years are not eligible to use bonus options unless the landmark or contributing \nstructure was destroyed by fire or other causes beyond the control of the owner, the \nonly structure on the site that was demolished was an accessory structure, or the \ndemolition was approved through demolition review. \n2. The bonus options refer to an administrative agency or qualified administrator. The \nadministrative and reporting requirements of each bonus must be met to the \nsatisfaction of the named agency or administrator. The named agencies are \nauthorized to publish administrative rules with clear and objective administrative \nrequirements. \n3. More than one bonus option may be used up to the overall maximums per site stated \nin Table 130-3. For development without any residential use, and for mixed use \ndevelopment that proposes fewer than 20 dwelling units and does not voluntarily \nprovide units on the site per the standards of 33.245.040.A, the affordable \ncommercial space bonus option must be used up to the maximum increment allowed \nfor the zone before any other bonus is allowed. Except as follows, adjustments to the \nmaximum FAR and height obtainable through bonuses are prohibited. Until January 2, \n2032, adjustments to increase the bonus height may be requested for new buildings  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n1/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-17 \nwhen at least 75 percent of the total floor area is in a residential use. In this case, \nadjustments to increase the bonus height by more than 20 percent of the base height \nlimit shown in Table 130-2, or 10 feet, whichever is greater, are prohibited. \n4. The increment of additional floor area ratio allowed per bonus is stated in Table 130-3 \nand described in Subsections C though E. \n5. The increment of additional height allowed per bonus is stated in Table 130-3, except \nthat additional height is not allowed where the step-down height limits of \n33.130.210.B.2 apply. \n \nTable 130-3 \nSummary of Bonus FAR and Height \n  CM1 CM2 CM3  CE CX \nOverall Maximums Per Zone \nMaximum FAR with bonus   2.5 to 1 4 to 1 5 to 1 4 to 1 6 to 1 \nMaximum height with bonus   35 ft. 55 ft.

Bonus height on a site where a Historic or Conservation Landmark or a contributing structure in a Historic or \nConservation District has been demolished within the past ten years is prohibited unless the landmark or contributing \nstructure was destroyed by fire or other causes beyond the control of the owner or the only structure on the site that was \ndemolished was an accessory structure.  \n[2] This larger overall maximum is only allowed through the Planned Development bonus option and required Planned \nDevelopment Review. \nC. Inclusionary housing bonus. Maximum height and FAR may be increased as stated in Table \n130-3 if one of the following is met: \n1. Mandatory inclusionary housing. Bonus height and FAR is allowed for development \nthat triggers 33.245, Inclusionary Housing. The amount of bonus floor area allowed is \nan amount equal to the net building area of the building that triggers 33.245, up to \nthe increment of additional FAR allowed as stated in Table 130-3. To qualify for this \nbonus, the applicant must provide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau \ncertifying that the regulations of 33.245 have been met; or \n2. Voluntary inclusionary housing. Maximum height and FAR may be increased as stated \nin Table 130-3 when one of the following voluntary bonus options is met: \na. Bonus height and FAR is allowed for projects that voluntarily comply with the \nstandards of 33.245.040 and 33.245.050. The amount of bonus floor area \nallowed is an amount equal to the net building area of the building that complies  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 1/1/25 \n130-18 \nwith 33.245.040 and .050, up to the increment of additional FAR allowed as \nstated in Table 130-3. To qualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a \nletter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the regulations of 33.245 \nhave been met. The letter is required to be submitted before a building permit \ncan be issued for development, but is not required in order to apply for a land \nuse review; or \nb. Bonus height and FAR is allowed in exchange for payment into the Affordable \nHousing Fund. For each square foot of floor area purchased a fee must be paid to \nthe Portland Housing Bureau (PHB). The Portland Housing Bureau collects and \nadministers the Affordable Housing Fund, and determines the fee. PHB \ndetermines the fee per square foot and updates the fee at least every three \nyears. The fee schedule is available from Portland Permitting & Development. To \nqualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a letter from PHB documenting \nthe amount that has been contributed. The letter is required to be submitted \nbefore a building permit can be issued for development, but is not required in \norder to apply for a land use review. \nD. Affordable commercial space bonus. Proposals that provide on-site affordable commercial \nspace, or pay into the Affordable Commercial Space Fund, may increase maximum height \nand FAR if all of the following are met. Floor area may be increased by 2 square feet for \neach square foot of on-site affordable commercial space provided, up to the maximum \nstated in Table 130-3. Floor area may be increased by 1 square foot for each square foot \npurchased through the Affordable Commercial Space Fund, up to the maximum stated in \nTable 130-3:  \n1. The applicant must submit with the development application a letter from the \nPortland Development Commission certifying that any program administrative \nrequirements have been met; and \n2. The property owner must execute a covenant with the City that complies with the \nrequirements of Section 33.700.060. The covenant must ensure that floor area built as \na result of this bonus will meet the administrative requirements of the Portland \nDevelopment Commission or qualified administrator. \nE. Planned Development bonus. Proposals that provide a combination of affordable housing, \na publicly accessible plaza or park, and energy efficient buildings may increase maximum \nheight and FAR as stated in Table 130-3 if approved through a Planned Development \nReview and Design Review (see Chapter 33.270 and Chapter 33.854). The site must be at \nleast two acres in size to be eligible for this bonus. Sites located within Historic or \nConservation districts are not eligible to use this bonus. \n33.130.215 Setbacks \nA. Purpose. The required building setbacks promote streetscapes that are consistent with the \ndesired character of the different commercial/mixed use zones. The setbacks promote \nbuildings close to the sidewalk to reinforce a pedestrian orientation and built-up \nstreetscape. The setback requirements for areas that abut residential zones promote \ncommercial/mixed use development that will maintain light, air, and the potential for \nprivacy for adjacent residential zones.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n1/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-19 \n The front setback requirements for Civic Corridors in Eastern and Western pattern areas \nprovide opportunities for additional pedestrian space and separation from the vehicle \ntraffic along these major streets to create an environment for building users and \npedestrians that is less impacted by close proximity to traffic, and provide opportunities for \nfront landscaping reflective of the vegetated characteristics of these neighborhood pattern \nareas. \n The minimum building setbacks along local service streets adjacent to residential zones \nwork together with requirements for step downs in building height (33.130.210.B.2.b.) to \nensure that there is a transition in street frontage characteristics to lower scale residential \nzones. In these situations, the building setback regulations promote street frontages with \nlandscaping and residential uses to provide a transition and a cohesive street environment \nwith similar street frontage characteristics on both sides of the street, and limit exterior \ndisplay and storage to minimize impacts to nearby residentially-zoned areas.  \nB. Minimum building setbacks. Minimum required building setbacks are listed below and \nsummarized in Table 130-2. Unless otherwise specified in this section, the minimum \nrequired setbacks apply to all buildings and structures on a site. Setbacks for exterior \ndevelopment are stated in 33.130.245, and setbacks for parking areas are stated in Chapter \n33.266, Parking, Loading and Transportation and Parking Demand Management.  \n1. Required setbacks from a street lot line. Unless as specified below, there is no \nminimum required setback from a street lot line: \na. The minimum setback required from a street lot line adjacent to a Civic Corridor \nshown on Map 130-1 is 10 feet.  \nb. The following minimum setbacks are required from a street lot line on the \nportion of the site that is across a local service street from an RF through RM2 or \nRMP zone. The setbacks do not apply in the CR or CM1 zones, or on or within 100 \nfeet of a transit street: \n(1) Buildings that are entirely in a residential use, and portions of buildings with \ndwelling units on the ground floor, must be set back 5 feet from a street lot \nline facing an RF through RM2 or RMP zone. The setback must be \nlandscaped to at least the L1 standard. Vehicle access is not allowed \nthrough the setback unless the local service street facing the residential \nzone is the only frontage for the site. Up to one third of the setback area can \nbe hard surfaced for pedestrian or bicycle access. Exterior display and \nstorage is not allowed within the setback. \n(2) All other buildings must be set back 10 feet from a street lot line facing an \nRF through RM2 or RMP zone. The setback must be landscaped to at least \nthe L1 standard. Vehicle access is not allowed through the setback unless \nthe local service street facing the residential zone is the only frontage for \nthe site. Up to one third of the setback area can be hard surfaced for \npedestrian or bicycle access. Exterior display and storage is not allowed \nwithin the setback. See Figure 130-2. \nc. See 33.130.250.D for the required garage entrance setback for a garage that is \naccessory to a house, attached house, manufactured home, or duplex.  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 1/1/25 \n130-20 \nd. Structured parking that does not allow exiting in a forward motion must be set \nback 18 feet from the street lot line. See 33.266.130.C. \nFigure 130-2 \nBuilding Setbacks and Step-Down Height Across a Local Service Street from Residential Zones \n \n2. Required setbacks from a lot line that is not a street lot line: \na. There is no minimum setback required from a lot line that abuts an OS, RX, C, E \nor CI zone. And, no setback is required from an internal lot line that is also a \nzoning line on sites with split zoning.  \nb. Except as follows, the required minimum setback from a lot line that abuts an RF \nthrough RM4, RMP, or IR zone is 10 feet. The required setback area must be \nlandscaped to the L3 standard. Areas paved for pedestrian or bicycle use can be \nlocated in the required building setback area, but may not extend closer than 5 \nfeet to a lot line abutting an RF through RM4 or RMP zone.  \n(1)  In the Inner Pattern Area on sites that abut a Civic or Neighborhood Corridor \nshown on Map 130-3 no setback is required from a lot line that abuts a \nproperty in the RM2-RM4 zones that also has a lot line on a Civic or \nNeighborhood Corridor. \n(2) Buildings that are 15 feet or less in height are exempt from the required \nsetback. \n(3) For both exceptions, any setback provided that is 5 feet or greater in depth \nmust be landscaped to at least the L3 standard for a distance of up to 10 \nfeet from the lot line. This means that if the building is setback 3 feet, no \nlandscaping is required, but if the building is setback 15 feet, then the first \n10 feet measured from the lot line must be landscaped.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n1/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-21 \nc. Windows in the walls of dwelling units must be setback a minimum of 5 feet \nfrom a lot line that abuts a C, E, I, or CI zoned lot. Windows of dwelling units that \nalso have other windows facing a street lot line or facing a dedicated open space \nthat is at least 10 feet in depth, such as a required setback or required outdoor \narea, are exempt from this standard. The setback area must be a minimum width \nof 12 feet or the width of the residential window, whichever is greater.  \n3. Extensions into required building setbacks and buffering requirements of Table 130-2. \na. The following features of a building may extend into a required building setback \nup to 20 percent of the depth of the setback. However, except for building eaves \nand stormwater planters, they may not extend closer than 5 feet to a lot line \nabutting an RF – RM4 or RMP zoned lot.  \n(1) Eaves, chimneys, fireplace inserts and vents, mechanical equipment, fire \nescapes, water collection cisterns and stormwater planters; \n(2) Stairways and wheelchair ramps that do not meet the standard of \nSubparagraph B.3.b below; and \n(3) Bays and bay windows may extend into a street setback, but not a required \nsetback abutting an RF – RM4 or RMP zoned lot, and also must meet the \nfollowing requirements: \n• Each bay and bay window may be up to 12 feet long, but the total area of \nall bays and bay windows on a building facade cannot be more than 30 \npercent of the area of the facade; \n• At least 30 percent of the area of the bay which faces the street lot line \nrequiring the setback must be glazing or glass block; \n• Bays and bay windows must cantilever beyond the foundation of the \nbuilding; and \n• The bay may not include any doors. \nb. The following minor features of a building are allowed to fully extend into \nrequired building setbacks, but may not extend closer than 5 feet to a lot line \nabutting an RF – RM4 or RMP zoned lot. \n(1) Uncovered decks, stairways, and wheelchair ramps with surfaces that are no \nmore than 2-1/2 feet above the ground;  \n(2) On lots that slope down from the street, vehicular and pedestrian entry \nbridges with surfaces that are no more than 2-1/2 feet above the average \nsidewalk elevation; and \n(3) Canopies, marquees, awnings, and similar features may fully extend into a \nstreet setback. \nc. Uncovered decks are allowed to fully extend into required street setbacks.  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 1/1/25 \n130-22 \n4. Detached accessory structures. For sites entirely in residential use, detached accessory \nstructures are subject to the multi-dwelling zone standards of Section 33.120.280. The \nsetback standards for detached accessory structures are stated in 33.130.265 below. \nFences are addressed in 33.130.270 below. \nC. Maximum building setbacks. Except as stated in Subsection E., the maximum building \nsetback standards are stated below.  \n1. Maximum setback standards. Unless otherwise specified, the maximum a building can \nbe set back from a street lot line is 10 feet, except on Civic Corridors shown on Map \n130-1, where the maximum set back is 20 feet. At least 50 percent of the length of the \nground level street-facing facade of the building must meet the maximum setback \nstandard. \n2. Applying the standard.  \na. Where an existing building is being altered, the standards apply to the ground \nlevel, street-facing facade of the entire building. See Figures 130-3 and 130-4. \nb. Where there is more than one building on the site, the standards of this \nparagraph apply to the combined ground level, street-facing facades of all of the \nbuildings. See Figures 130-5 and 130-6. \nc. In the CR, CM1, CM2, CM3, and CX zones, and in the CE zone within a Pedestrian \nDistrict, if the site has street lot lines on three or more streets, the maximum \nsetback standard only applies to two of the streets. When this occurs, the \nstandard must be applied to the streets with the highest transit street \nclassifications. If the site is a through lot, the maximum setback standard only \napplies to the street with the highest transit street classification. If multiple \nstreets have the same highest transit street classification, the applicant may \nchoose which street or streets to apply the standard. \nd. In the CE zone outside of pedestrian districts, the maximum setback standard \nonly applies to transit streets unless the site does not have a street lot line on a \ntransit street. If the site does not have a street lot line on a transit street, then \nthe maximum setback standard applies to one street, and if there is more than \none street, the applicant may choose which street to apply the standard. If the \nsite has street lot lines on three or more transit streets, the maximum setback \nstandard applies only to two of the streets. When this occurs, the standard must \nbe applied to the streets with the highest transit classification. If multiple transit \nstreets have the same highest street classification, the applicant may choose \nwhich streets to apply the standard. \ne. For buildings where all of the floor area is in residential use, the street-facing \nfacade of an open porch that meets the following standards is included as part of \nthe ground level, street-facing facade of the building: \n(1) For houses, attached houses, manufactured homes and duplexes, the porch \nmust be at least 25 square feet in area. For multi-dwelling structures, the \nporch must be at least 9 feet wide and 7 feet deep; \n(2) The porch must have at least one entrance facing the street; and  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n1/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-23 \n(3) The porch must have a roof that is no more than 12 feet above the floor of \nthe porch and at least 30 percent solid. This standard may be met by having \n30 percent of the porch area covered with a solid roof, or by having the \nentire area covered with a trellis or other open material if no more than 70 \npercent of the area of the material is open. \n3. Exception. The maximum building setbacks do not apply to primary structures under \n500 square feet in floor area, or to detached accessory structures. The street-facing \nfacades of detached accessory structures do not count towards meeting maximum \nsetback standards. See Figure 130-5. \nD. Improvements in the setback area between a building and a street lot line.  \n1. General standard. The land between any building and a street lot line must be \nlandscaped to at least the L1 level and/or hard-surfaced for use by pedestrians. This \narea may be counted towards any minimum landscaped area requirements. \nVegetated stormwater management facilities used to meet Bureau of Environmental \nServices stormwater management requirements, and residential outdoor areas, such \nas play areas and garden plots, as well as vehicle areas and exterior display, storage, \nand work activities, if allowed, are exempt from this standard. Bicycle parking may be \nlocated in the area between a building and a street lot line when the area is hard \nsurfaced. \n2. Improvements within transit street maximum building setbacks. Along transit streets, \nat least 50 percent of the setback area between the street lot line and the portion of \nthe building that complies with the maximum building setback must be hard surfaced \nfor use by pedestrians. Buildings entirely in a residential use are exempt from this \nstandard. \nFigure 130-3 \nAlteration to Existing Building in Conformance with Maximum Setback Standard \n  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 1/1/25 \n130-24 \nFigure 130-4 \nAlterations to Existing Building \n \n \nFigure 130-5 \nCalculating Maximum Building Setback When More Than One Building On Site \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n1/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-25 \nFigure 130-6 \nNew Buildings on Sites with Buildings That Do Not Meet the Maximum Building Setback \n \nE. Alternative maximum building setback for large retailers.  \n1. Purpose. The intent of the regulations is to allow deeper street setbacks for very large \nretail stores locating along transit streets or in Pedestrian Districts in exchange for a \npedestrian and transit-friendly main street type of development. These large retail \nsites can still be transit-supportive and pedestrian-friendly by placing smaller buildings \nclose to the street and by creating an internal circulation system that is similar to \nstreets in order to separate the parking area into blocks. The intent is to encourage \ndevelopment that will, over time, form a pedestrian-friendly main street along the \nperimeter of the parking blocks and provide connectivity within the site and to \nadjacent streets and uses. \n2. Regulation. Sites that have at least one building with at least 60,000 square feet of \nfloor area in Retail Sales and Service use are exempt from the maximum setback \nrequirement of Table 130-2 and the vehicle area frontage limitations of \n33.266.130.C.3 if all of the requirements of this paragraph are met. For sites with \nfrontage on more than one transit street or more than one street in a Pedestrian \nDistrict, this exemption may be used only along one transit street frontage or frontage \nalong a street in a Pedestrian District. \na. Other buildings on the site have ground level walls within the maximum setback \nfor at least 25 percent of the frontage on a transit street or street in a Pedestrian \nDistrict. These buildings must be constructed before or at the same time as the \nlarge retail store;  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 1/1/25 \n130-26 \nb. Internal circulation system. An internal circulation system that meets the \nfollowing standards must be provided: \n(1) Internal accessways that are similar to streets must divide the site into \nparking areas that are no greater than 55,000 square feet; \n(2) These accessways must connect to the transit street, or street in a \nPedestrian District, at least every 250 feet;  \n(3) Each internal accessway must have at least one auto travel lane, curbs, and \nunobstructed sidewalks on both sides and one of the following must be \nmet: \n• The sidewalks must be at least 10 feet wide and planted with trees a \nmaximum of 30 feet on center. Trees must be planted in the center of \nunpaved tree wells at least 18 square feet, with a minimum dimension \nof 3 feet. The unpaved area may be covered with a tree grate. Tree \nwells must be adjacent to the curb, and must be located so there is at \nleast 6 feet of unobstructed sidewalk; or \n• The sidewalks must be at least 6 feet wide. There must be a planting \nstrip at least 4 feet wide. The planting strip must be between the curb \nand the sidewalk, and be landscaped to at least the L1 standard, except \nthat trees cannot be grouped. \n(4) Along each internal accessway that intersects a transit street, parking must \nbe provided between both sidewalks and the auto travel lanes except for \nwithin 75 feet of the transit street intersection, measured from the street \nlot line, where parking is not allowed; \n(5) Curb extensions that are at least the full depth of the parking must be \nprovided, as shown in Figure 130-7, at the intersections of internal \naccessways that have parking; and \n(6) The internal accessways are excluded from the portion of the parking and \nloading area used to calculate required interior landscaping. \nc. Connections between sites. This standard applies to all commercial, office, or \ninstitutional development that is adjacent to sites either developed for \nCommercial or Institutional use, or zoned C, E, I, CI, or IR. The system must \nconnect the buildings on the site to these adjacent sites.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n1/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-27 \nFigure 130-7 \nInternal Circulation System \n \n \n33.130.220 Building Coverage \nA. Purpose. The building coverage standards limit the footprint of buildings and work with the \nFAR, height, and setback standards to control the overall scale of development. The \nstandards promote development consistent with the desired character of the zone. The \nstandards allow a high degree of lot coverage in the Inner Neighborhoods pattern area to \nreflect the urban development patterns and continuous building frontages of the area. The \nstandards for Eastern and Western pattern areas work in conjunction with landscaping \nrequirements to respond to the less intensely developed characteristics of these areas. \n  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 1/1/25 \n130-28 \nB. Building coverage standards. The maximum building coverage standards are stated in \nTable 130-2, and the standards apply based on pattern area geography. Map 130-2 \nidentifies the pattern areas. Maximum building coverage applies to all buildings and \ncovered structures.  \n33.130.222 Building Length and Facade Articulation \nA. Purpose. These standards, along with the height and setback standards, limit the bulk of \nbuildings close to the street. These standards help ensure that large buildings will be \ndivided into smaller components that relate to the scale and patterns of Portland’s \ncommercial/mixed-use areas and add visual interest and variety to the street environment. \nB. Maximum building length. In the CR, CM1, CM2, CM3, and CE zones, the maximum \nbuilding length for the portion of a building located within 20 feet of a street lot line is 200 \nfeet. The portions of buildings subject to this standard must be separated by a minimum of \n20 feet when located on the same site. See Figure 130-8. \n \nFigure 130-8 \nMaximum Building Length \n \nC. Facade articulation.  \n1. Where the standard applies. This standard applies in the CM2, CM3 and CE zones as \nfollows. Development that includes a residential use is exempt from this standard until \nJanuary 1, 2029: \na.  In the CM2 and CE zones, the standard applies to buildings more than 35 feet \nhigh that have facade areas of more than 3,500 square feet within 20 feet of a \nstreet property line.  \nb.  In the CM3 zone, the standard applies to buildings more than 45 feet high that \nhave facade areas of more than 4,500 square feet within 20 feet of a street \nproperty line.  \nc. Portions of building facades that are vertically separated by a gap of at least 10 \nfeet in width extending at least 20 feet in depth from the street property line are  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n1/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-29 \nconsidered to be separate facades areas for the purposes of the facade area \nmeasurements. See Figure 130-9. \n2.  The standard. At least 25 percent of the area of a street-facing facade within 20 feet of \na street lot line must be divided into facade planes that are off-set by at least 2 feet in \ndepth from the rest of the facade. Facade area used to meet the facade articulation \nstandard may be recessed behind or project out from the primary facade plane, but \nprojections into street right-of-way, and balconies that do not count toward floor area \ndo not count toward meeting this standard. See Figure 130-10.  \nFigure 130-9 \nFacade Articulation \n \n \nFigure 130-10 \nFacade Articulation \n \n33.130.225 Landscaped Areas \nA. Purpose. Landscaping is required in some zones because it is attractive and it helps to \nsoften the effects of built and paved areas. Landscaping also helps cool the air \ntemperature, intercept rainfall and reduce stormwater runoff by providing unpaved \npermeable surface. Landscaping can also provide food for people and habitat for birds and \nother wildlife. As an alternative to conventional landscaping, a range of urban green \noptions are provided in the CM2 and CM3 zones in the Inner Neighborhoods pattern area  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 1/1/25 \n130-30 \nto reflect this area’s more urban development patterns and historic storefront commercial \ncharacteristics. Landscaping is required for all commercial/mixed use-zoned lands abutting \nR zoned lands and as screening for parking lots (see Chapter 33.266) to provide buffering \nand promote livability. \nB. Minimum landscaped area. The minimum amount of required landscaped area is stated in \nTable 130-2. Any required landscaping, such as for required setbacks or parking lots, \napplies towards meeting the minimum amount of required landscaped area. Sites \ndeveloped with a house, attached house or duplex are exempt from the required minimum \nlandscaped area standard. The required landscape area must meet one of the following: \n1. Unless allowed by Paragraph B.2., required landscaped areas must: \na. Be at ground level, except when in raised planters that are used to meet \nminimum Bureau of Environmental Services stormwater management \nrequirements; and  \nb. Comply with at least the L1 standard described in Chapter 33.248, Landscaping \nand Screening, or be a vegetated stormwater management facility that meets \nminimum Bureau of Environmental Services stormwater management \nrequirements. However, up to one-third of the required landscaped area may be \nimproved for active or passive recreational use, or for use by pedestrians. \nExamples of active or passive recreational use include walkways, play areas, \nplazas, picnic areas, garden plots, and unenclosed recreational facilities.  \n2. Urban green alternative landscaped area. In the CM2 and CM3 zones in the Inner \npattern area shown on Map 130-2, one or more of the following may be used to meet \nthe required landscape area: \na. Ecoroof. An ecoroof area may apply toward meeting the required landscaped \narea standard at a ratio of 4 square feet of ecoroof area for every 1 square foot \nof required landscaped area. The ecoroof area must be approved by the Bureau \nof Environmental Services as being in compliance with the Stormwater \nManagement Manual. \nb. Large trees. The minimum required landscaped area may be reduced to 10 \npercent of site area when the site includes an area with minimum dimensions of \n30 feet by 30 feet planted with at least one large-canopy tree. An existing large-\ncanopy tree can be used to meet this requirement, subject to the Tree Protection \nSpecifications of Title 11 (Section 11.60.030). Large canopy trees are defined in \nSection 33.248.030, Plant Materials. At least 50 percent of the ground area \nwithin this space must planted with ground cover plants and the remainder may \nbe hard-surfaced for use by pedestrians. \nc. Raised landscaped areas. Landscaped areas raised above ground level may be \nused to meet the minimum landscaped area standard when landscaped to at \nleast the L1 standard and soil depth is a minimum of 30 inches. Large trees are \nnot allowed in raised landscaped area used to meet this alternative. \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n1/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-31 \nd. Pervious pavement. Up to 50 percent of the required landscaped area may be \nimproved for pedestrian use, such as walkways and plazas, if the area is surfaced \nwith pervious pavement approved by the Bureau of Environmental Services as \nbeing in compliance with the Stormwater Management Manual. If this provision \nis used, no impervious surfaces can be counted toward meeting the minimum \nlandscaped area standard. \n33.130.227 Trees \nRequirements for street trees and for on-site tree preservation, protection, and overall tree density \nare specified in Title 11. See Chapter 11.50, Trees in Development Situations. \n33.130.228 Required Outdoor Areas \nA. Purpose. The required outdoor areas standards ensure opportunities for residents to have \non-site access to outdoor space for recreation, relaxation, natural area, or growing food. \nRequired outdoor areas are an important aspect for addressing the livability of a property \nwith residential units by providing residents with opportunities for outdoor activities, some \noptions for outdoor privacy, and a healthy environment. The standards ensure that \noutdoor areas are located so that residents have convenient access. These standards also \nallow for outdoor area requirements to be met by indoor community facilities because they \nprovide opportunities for recreation or gathering.  \nB. Requirements.  \n1. Amount required:  \na. On sites that are up to 20,000 square feet in total area, at least 36 square feet of \noutdoor area is required for each dwelling unit on the site;  \nb. For sites that are more than 20,000 square feet in total area, at least 48 square \nfeet of outdoor area is required for each dwelling unit on the site; \nc. For any site with a congregate housing facility, at least 10 percent total site area \nmust be provided as common area. \n2. Size, location and configuration. Required outdoor area may be provided as individual, \nprivate outdoor areas, such as patios or balconies, or as common, shared areas, such \nas outdoor courtyards and play areas, or indoor recreational facilities or community \nrooms. There also may be a combination of individual and common areas. \na. Individual unit outdoor areas. Where a separate outdoor area is provided for an \nindividual unit, it must be designed so that a 4-foot by 6-foot dimension will fit \nentirely within it. The outdoor area must be directly accessible to the unit. \nBalconies that extend over street right-of-way count towards meeting this \nstandard. Areas used for pedestrian circulation to more than one dwelling unit \ndo not count towards meeting the required outdoor area. If the area is at ground \nlevel it may extend up to 5 feet into a required front setback, and may extend \ninto required side and rear setbacks as long as the area is not closer than 5 feet \nto a lot line abutting an RF through RM4 zoned lot. \nb. Common areas. There are two types of common area:  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 1/1/25 \n130-32 \n(1) Outdoor common area. Where outdoor areas are common, shared areas, \neach area must be designed so that it is at least 500 square feet in area and \nmust measure at least 20 feet in all directions. The outdoor common area \nmust be located within 20 feet of a building entrance providing access to \nresidential units. \n(2) Indoor common area. Where an indoor common area is provided, it must be \nan indoor recreational facility or an indoor tenant community room. Indoor \ncommon areas that are not recreational facilities or community rooms, such \nas lobbies, hallways, laundry facilities, storage rooms, and vehicle or bicycle \nfacilities, cannot be used to meet this requirement. \nc. Combination of individual and common areas. Where a combination of individual \nunit and common areas is provided, each individual area must meet \nSubparagraph B.2.a and each common area must meet B.2.b above, and \ntogether must provide a total amount of space equivalent to the combined \namount of outdoor area required for each  \ndwelling unit. \n3. Surfacing materials. Required outdoor areas must be surfaced with lawn, pavers, \ndecking, or sport court paving which allows the area to be used for active or passive \nrecreational use.  \n4. User amenities. User amenities, such as tables, benches, trees, shrubs, planter boxes, \ngarden plots, drinking fountains, spas, or pools, may be placed in the outdoor area. \nCommon, shared outdoor areas may also be developed with amenities such as play \nareas, plazas, roof-top patios, picnic areas, and open recreational facilities. \n33.130.230 Windows \nA. Windows in street-facing facades.  \n1.  Purpose. This standard: \n• Ensures that there is a visual connection between the living area of the residence \nand the street; \n• Enhances public safety by allowing people to survey their neighborhood from \ninside their residences; and \n• Provides a more pleasant pedestrian environment by preventing large expanses of \nblank facades along streets. \n2. Where this standard applies. This standard applies to street-facing facades of \nbuildings. Where a proposal is for an alteration or addition to existing development, \nthe applicant may choose to apply the standard either to the portion being altered or \nadded, or to the entire street-facing facade.  \n3. Windows in street-facing facades. At least 15 percent of the area of each facade that \nfaces a street lot line must be windows or main entrance doors. Windows used to \nmeet this standard must allow views from the building to the street. Glass block does \nnot meet this standard. Windows in garage doors do not count toward meeting this \nstandard, but windows in garage walls do count toward meeting this standard. To \ncount toward meeting this standard a door must be at the main entrance and face the  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n1/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-33 \nstreet lot line. For structures subject to ground floor window requirements, windows \nused to meet ground floor window requirements may also be used to meet  \nthis standard. \n4. Exemptions: \na. Development on flag lots or on lots that slope up or down from the street with \nan average slope of 20 percent or more are exempt from this standard. \nb. Detached accessory structures located more than 20 feet from a street lot line \nare exempt from this standard. \nB. Ground floor windows.  \n1. Purpose. In the commercial/mixed use zones, blank walls on the ground level of \nbuildings are limited in order to: \n• Provide a pleasant, rich, and diverse pedestrian experience by connecting \nactivities occurring within a structure to adjacent sidewalk areas, or allowing \npublic art at the ground level; \n• Encourage continuity of retail and service uses;  \n• Encourage surveillance opportunities by restricting fortress-like facades at street  \nlevel; and  \n• Avoid a monotonous pedestrian environment.  \n2. Ground floor window standard for wall area that is not the wall of a dwelling unit.  The \nfollowing standards apply to the portions of a ground floor wall of a street-facing \nfacade that is not the wall of a dwelling unit:  \na. General standard.  \n(1) Windows must cover at least 40 percent of the ground floor wall area of \nstreet-facing facades that are 20 feet or closer to a street lot line or a \npublicly-accessible plaza. For the purposes of this standard, ground floor \nwall areas include all exterior wall areas from 2 feet to 10 feet above the \nfinished grade, and include openings in the walls of structured parking. See \nFigure 130-11. \n(2) If the lot has more than one street frontage, then the following apply: \n• The ground floor window standard in Subsubparagraph B.2.a(1) applies \nto the facade that faces the highest transit street classification. All other \nground level street-facing facades that are 20 feet or closer to the street \nlot line must have windows that cover 25 percent of the ground level \nwall area. Transit street classifications are identified in the \nTransportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan.  \n• If two or more streets have the same highest transit street classification, \nthen the applicant may choose on which of those streets to meet the \nhigher standard in Subsubparagraph B.2.a(1). \n• The walls of structured parking that are part of a street-facing façade \nthat is not required to meet the higher standard in Subsubparagraph  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 1/1/25 \n130-34 \nB.2.a(1) may be set back at least 5 feet and landscaped to the L2 \nstandard instead of providing 25 percent windows.  \nb. Exemptions:  \n(1) Houses, attached houses, manufactured homes, duplexes, attached \nduplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes are exempt from this Section;  \n(2) Ground floor street-facing walls of dwelling units must meet the standards \nin Paragraph B.4; and  \n(3) One opening for vehicular access to onsite parking area. \n3. Qualifying window features. Required ground floor window areas must be windows \nthat allow views into working areas, lobbies, stairwells, residential units or residential \nbuilding common areas; glazing in pedestrian entrances; or display windows that are \nat least 24 inches deep set into a wall. Windows into storage areas, vehicle parking \nareas, mechanical and utility areas, garbage and recycling areas, and display cases \nattached to outside walls do not qualify. Windows into bicycle parking areas are \nallowed to qualify for up to 25 percent of the ground floor windows coverage \nrequirement. Except for the windows of residential units and clerestory windows \nlocated above doors or other windows, the bottom of qualifying windows must be no \nmore than 4 feet above the adjacent exterior grade. \n \n4. Ground floor window and frontage standards for dwelling units. The ground floor wall \narea of street-facing facades of dwelling units that are 20 feet or closer to a street lot \nline must meet at least one of the following standards. For the purpose of these \nstandards, ground floor wall areas include all exterior wall areas from 2 feet to 10 feet \nabove the finished grade, and include openings in the walls of structured parking. See \nFigure 130-11: \na. Flexible ground floor design. The ground floor window standard of Subparagraph \nB.2.a(1) must be met, and the ground level of the building must be designed and \nconstructed as follows: \nFigure 130-11 \nGround Floor Windows \n Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n1/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-35 \n(1) The distance from the finished floor to the bottom of the ceiling structure \nabove must be at least 12 feet. The bottom of the structure above includes \nsupporting beams; \n(2) The area meeting this standard must be at least 25 feet deep, measured \nfrom the street-facing facade; and \n(3) Each unit must include a front entrance that is located at the level of the \nfinished grade and can be accessed without steps. \nb.

The equipment is set back from roof edges facing the R zone 3 feet for each foot of \nheight of the equipment. \nD. Other screening requirements. The screening requirements for parking, exterior storage, \nand exterior display areas are stated with the regulations for those types of development. \n33.130.240 Pedestrian Standards \nA. Purpose. The pedestrian standards encourage a safe, attractive, and usable pedestrian \ncirculation system in all developments. They ensure a direct pedestrian connection \nbetween abutting streets and buildings on the site, and between buildings and other \nactivities within the site. In addition, they provide for connections between adjacent sites, \nwhere feasible. \nB. The standards. The standards of this Section apply to all development except houses, \nattached houses, and duplexes. An on-site pedestrian circulation system must be provided. \nThe system must meet all standards of this Subsection. \n1. Connections. The on-site pedestrian circulation system must provide connections as \nspecified below: \na. Connection between streets and entrances.  \n(1) Sites with one street frontage.  \n• Generally. There must be a connection between one main entrance of \neach building on the site and the adjacent street. The connection may \nnot be more than 20 feet longer or 120 percent of the straight line \ndistance, whichever is less. Buildings separated from the street by other \nbuildings are exempt from this standard. \n• Household Living. If a building is located within 40 feet of a street lot \nline, and all of the floor area in the building is in a Household Living use, \nthen there must be at least one connection between one main entrance \nand the adjacent street. The connection may not be more than 20 feet \nlonger or 120 percent of the straight line distance, whichever is less. \n• Tree preservation. If a tree that is at least 12 inches in diameter is \nproposed for preservation, and the location of the tree or its root \nprotection zone would prevent the standard of this paragraph from \nbeing met, the connection may be up to 200 percent of the straight line \ndistance.   Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 1/1/25 \n130-38 \n(2) Sites with more than one street frontage. Where the site has more than one \nstreet frontage, the following must be met: \n• The standard of Subparagraph B.1.a(1) must be met to connect the \nmain entrance of each building on the site to the closest sidewalk or \nroadway if there are no sidewalks; \n• An additional connection, which does not have to be a straight line \nconnection, is required between each of the other streets and a \npedestrian entrance. However, if at least 50 percent of a street facing \nfacade is within 10 feet of the street, no connection is required to  \nthat street.  \nb. Internal connections. The system must connect all main entrances on the site \nand provide connections to other areas of the site used by building occupants, \nincluding parking areas, bicycle parking, recreational areas, common outdoor \nareas, and any pedestrian amenities. Pedestrian connections to public sidewalks \nmay substitute for internal connections for main entrances that are within 10 \nfeet of a public sidewalk. \n2. Materials.  \na. The circulation system must be hard-surfaced and be at least 6 feet wide. On \nsites where all of the floor area is in Household Living, segments of the \ncirculation system that provide access to no more than 4 units may be 3 feet \nwide.  \nb. Except as allowed in Subparagraph B.2.d., where the system crosses driveways, \nparking areas, and loading areas, the system must be clearly identifiable, through \nthe use of elevation changes, speed bumps, a different paving material, or other \nsimilar method. Striping does not meet this requirement. Elevation changes and \nspeed bumps must be at least 4 inches high. \nc. Except as allowed in Subparagraph B.2.d., where the system is parallel and \nadjacent to an auto travel lane, the system must be a raised path or be separated \nfrom the auto travel lane by a raised curb, bollards, landscaping or other physical \nbarrier. If a raised path is used it must be at least 4 inches high and the ends of \nthe raised portions must be equipped with curb ramps. Bollard spacing must be \nno further apart than 5 feet on center. \nd. On sites where all the floor area is in a Household Living use, the pedestrian \ncirculation system may be located within an auto travel lane if the auto travel \nlane provides access to 16 or fewer parking spaces and the entire auto travel lane \nis surfaced with paving blocks or bricks. \n3. Lighting. The on-site pedestrian circulation system must be lighted to a level where \nthe system can be used at night by the employees, residents, and customers. \n33.130.242 Transit Street Main Entrance \nA. Purpose. Locating the main entrance to a use on a transit street provides convenient \npedestrian access between the use and public sidewalks and transit facilities, and so \npromotes walking and the use of transit.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n1/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-39 \nB. Applicability.  \n1. Generally.

See Section 33.130.250, General Requirements for Small Housing Types, for \nadditional requirements for garages that are accessory to residential \ndevelopment.  \n33.130.270 Fences \nA. Purpose. The fence regulations promote the positive benefits of fences without negatively \nimpacting the community or endangering public or vehicle safety. Fences near streets are \nkept low in order to allow visibility into and out of the site and to ensure visibility for \nmotorists. Fences in any required side or rear setback are limited in height so as to not \nconflict with the purpose for the setback.  \nB. Types of fences. The standards apply to walls, fences, and screens of all types whether \nopen, solid, wood, metal, wire, masonry, or other material. \nC. Location and heights.  \n1. Fences abutting street lot lines and pedestrian connections. Within 10 feet of a street \nlot line or lot line that abuts a pedestrian connection, fences that meet the following \nstandards are allowed: \na. Fences that are more than 50 percent sight-obscuring may be up to 3-1/2  \nfeet high. \nb. Fences that are 50 percent or less sight-obscuring may be up to 8 feet high. \n2. Fences abutting other lot lines. Fences up to 8 feet high are allowed in required \nbuilding setbacks along all other lot lines.  \n3. Fences in all other locations. The height for fences in locations other than described in \nParagraphs C.1 and C.2 is the same as the regular height limits of the zone.  \nD. Reference to other regulations. Electrified fences are regulated under Title 26, Electrical \nRegulations. The use of barbed wire is regulated under Title 24, Building Regulations.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.130 \n3/1/25 Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n130-49 \n33.130.275 Demolitions \nA. Generally. Demolition on a site that requires a demolition permit is subject to the tree \npreservation and protection requirements of Title 11, Trees. See Chapter 11.50, Trees in \nDevelopment Situations. \nB. Historic resources. Demolition of historic resources is regulated by Chapter 33.445, Historic \nResource Overlay Zone. \nC. CX zone landscaping. In the CX zone, sites must be landscaped within 6 months of the \ndemolition of buildings unless there is an approved development for the site. Approved \ndevelopment means a project approved through design review. The landscaping must meet \nat least the L1 standard of Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening, except that no \nshrubs or trees are required. \n33.130.285 Nonconforming Development \nExisting development that does not conform to the development standards of this chapter may be \nsubject to the regulations of Chapter 33.258, Nonconforming Situations. \n33.130.290 Parking, Loading, and Transportation and Parking Demand Management \nThe regulations for vehicle parking, bicycle parking, loading, and transportation and parking demand \nmanagement are stated in Chapter 33.266, Parking, Loading, and Transportation and Parking \nDemand Management. \n33.130.292 Street and Pedestrian Connections \nA.  Large site pedestrian connectivity. \n1.  Purpose. The large site pedestrian connectivity standard implements regional \npedestrian and bicycle connectivity standards. The standard enhances direct \nmovement by pedestrians and bicycles between destinations and increases the \nconvenience of travelling by foot or bike. The standard also protects public health and \nsafety by ensuring safe movement and access through a large site. The standard \nprovides flexibility for locating the pedestrian connection in a manner that addresses \nsite constraints such as existing development. \n2. When does the standard apply. The large site pedestrian connectivity standard applies \nto new development and major remodeling on sites that are more than 5 acres in size. \n3. Standard. If the site does not have pedestrian connections at least every 330 feet as \nmeasured from the centerline of each connection, then dedication of ROW for \npedestrian connections is required. \n4. Exemptions. Dedication of right-of-way for pedestrian connections is not required in: \na. The Central City plan district; and  \nb. Areas of a site that are in the Environmental Protection overlay zone, the \nEnvironmental Conservation overlay zone, or have slopes with an average slope \nof 20 percent or greater. This means that if the 330 feet interval falls in one of \nthese areas, that pedestrian connection is not required.  Chapter 33.130 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommercial/Mixed Use Zones 3/1/25 \n130-50 \n5. Pedestrian connection alignment, width and design. The Bureau of Transportation \nmust approve the alignment of the pedestrian connections. The final alignment must \nensure that pedestrian connections are located at least 200 feet apart. The Bureau of \nTransportation must also approve the width of, and configuration of element within, \nthe pedestrian connections. \nB. Additional requirements for street and pedestrian/bicycle connections are regulated by the \nBureau of Transportation. See Section 17.88.040, Through Streets, of the Portland  \nCity Code.  \n33.130.295 Signs \nThe sign regulations are stated in Title 32, Signs and Related Regulations. \n33.130.305 Superblock Requirements \nDevelopment in the CM2, CM3, CE, and CX zones which are on land that includes vacated rights-of-\nway may be subject to the superblock standards of Chapter 33.293, Superblocks. \n33.130.310 Recycling Areas \nRequirements for recycling areas are regulated by the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability. See \nSection 17.102.270, Businesses and Multifamily Complexes Required to Recycle, of the Portland City \nCode. \n \n(Amended by: Ord. No. 165594, effective 7/8/92; Ord.

The zones reflect the \ndiversity of industrial and business areas in the City. The zones differ in the mix of allowed uses, the \nallowed intensity of development, and the development standards. The regulations promote areas \nwhich consist of uses and developments which will support the economic viability of the specific \nzoning district and of the City. The regulations protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, \naddress area character, and address environmental concerns. In addition, the regulations provide \ncertainty to property owners, developers, and neighbors about the limits of what is allowed. \n33.140.020 List of the Employment and Industrial Zones \nThe full and short names of the employment and industrial zones and their map symbols are listed \nbelow. When this Title refers to the employment or E zones it is referring to the first three listed. \nWhen this Title refers to the industrial or I zones, it is referring to the last three listed. \nFull Name Short Name/Map Symbol \nGeneral Employment 1 EG1 \nGeneral Employment 2 EG2 \nCentral Employment EX \nGeneral Industrial 1 IG1 \nGeneral Industrial 2 IG2 \nHeavy Industrial IH \n33.140.030 Characteristics of the Zones \nA. General Employment. The General Employment zones implement the Mixed Employment \nmap designation of the Comprehensive Plan. The zones allow a wide range of employment \nopportunities without potential conflicts from interspersed residential uses. The emphasis \nof the zones is on industrial, industrially-related, and office uses, typically in a low-rise, flex-\nspace development pattern. Retail uses are allowed but limited in intensity to maintain \nadequate employment development opportunities. The development standards for each \nzone are intended to allow new development which is similar in character to existing \ndevelopment. The intent is to promote viable and attractive industrial/commercial areas.  \n1. General Employment 1. EG1 areas generally have smaller lots and a grid block pattern. \nThe area is mostly developed, with sites having high building coverages and buildings \nwhich are usually close to the street. EG1 zoned lands will tend to be on strips or small \nareas. \n2. General Employment 2. EG2 areas have larger lots and an irregular or large block \npattern. The area is less developed, with sites having medium and low building \ncoverages and buildings which are usually set back from the street. EG2 zoned lands \nwill generally be on larger areas than those zoned EG1. \nB. Central Employment. This zone implements the Central Employment map designation of \nthe Comprehensive Plan. The zone allows mixed-uses and is intended for areas in the \ncenter of the City that have predominantly industrial type development. The intent of the \nzone is to allow industrial and commercial uses which need a central location. Residential  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-3 \nuses are allowed, but are not intended to predominate or set development standards for \nother uses in the area. The development standards are intended to allow new \ndevelopment which is similar in character to existing development. \nC. General Industrial. The General Industrial zones are two of the three zones that implement \nthe Industrial Sanctuary map designation of the Comprehensive Plan. The zones provide \nareas where most industrial uses may locate, while other uses are restricted to prevent \npotential conflicts and to preserve land for industry. The development standards for each \nzone are intended to allow new development which is similar in character to existing \ndevelopment. The intent is to promote viable and attractive industrial areas.  \n1. General Industrial 1. IG1 areas generally have smaller lots and a grid block pattern. \nThe area is mostly developed, with sites having high building coverages and buildings \nwhich are usually close to the street. IG1 areas tend to be the City's older  \nindustrial areas. \n2. General Industrial 2. IG2 areas generally have larger lots and an irregular or large block \npattern. The area is less developed, with sites having medium and low building \ncoverages and buildings which are usually set back from the street. \nD. Heavy Industrial. This zone is one of the three zones that implement the Industrial \nSanctuary map designation of the Comprehensive Plan. The zone provides areas where all \nkinds of industries may locate including those not desirable in other zones due to their \nobjectionable impacts or appearance. The development standards are the minimum \nnecessary to assure safe, functional, efficient, and environmentally sound development. \n33.140.040 Other Zoning Regulations \nThe regulations in this chapter state the allowed uses and the development standards for the base \nzones. Sites in overlay zones or plan districts and designated historical landmarks are subject to \nadditional regulations which supersede those of this Chapter. The Official Zoning Maps indicated \nwhich sites are subject to the additional regulations. Specific uses or development types may also be \nsubject to regulations in the 200s series of chapters. \n33.140.050 Neighborhood Contact in EG and I Zones \nA. Purpose. Neighborhood contact is required when a new storage structure for any type of \nfuel will be built on a Bulk Fossil Fuel Terminal because of the impacts that fuel projects can \nhave on the surrounding community.  \nB. Neighborhood contact requirement. Proposals meeting the following conditions are \nsubject to the neighborhood contact steps of 33.705.020.B., Neighborhood Contact II. All of \nthe steps in 33.705.020.B must be completed before an application for a building permit \ncan be submitted. \n1. The proposed development has not been subject to a land use review; and \n2. The proposed development includes at least one new structure for the storage of any \ntype of fuel on a site with a Bulk Fossil Fuel Terminal use.  Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-4 \n33.140.055 Neighborhood Contact in EX Zone \nNeighborhood contact is a set of outreach steps that must be taken before certain developments \ncan be submitted for approval. Neighborhood contact is required as follows: \nA. Neighborhood contact I. \n1. Neighborhood contact I requirements. When proposed development will add at least \n10,000 square feet and not more than 25,000 square feet of net building area to a \nsite, the neighborhood contact steps of 33.705.020.A., Neighborhood contact I, are \nrequired. All the steps in 33.705.020.A. must be completed before an application for a \nbuilding permit can be submitted. \n2. Exemption. If the proposed development has already met the neighborhood contact \nrequirements as part of a land use review process, it is exempt from the neighborhood \ncontact requirements.  \nB. Neighborhood contact II. \n1. Neighborhood contact II requirements. When the proposed development will add \nmore than 25,000 square feet of net building area to a site, the neighborhood contact \nsteps of 33.705.020.B., Neighborhood contact II, are required. All of the steps in \n33.705.020.B. must be completed before an application for a building permit can be \nsubmitted. \n2. Exemption. If the proposed development has already met the neighborhood contact \nrequirements as part of a land use review process, it is exempt from the neighborhood \ncontact requirements. \nUse Regulations \n33.140.100 Primary Uses \nA. Allowed uses. Uses allowed in the employment and industrial zones are listed in Table 140-\n1 with a \"Y\".

Where the use and site meet the regulations of Chapter \n33.237, Food Production and Distribution, the applicant may choose whether it is \nallowed as a Market Garden.  \n16. Bulk Fossil Fuel Terminals. This regulation applies to all parts of Table 140-1 that have \na [16].  \na. Existing Bulk Fossil Fuel Terminals. Bulk Fossil Fuel Terminals that existed on \nAugust 31, 2022 are allowed, but the total amount of fossil fuel that can be \nstored on the site in storage tanks is limited to the fossil fuel storage tank \ncapacity that existed on August 31, 2022. Total fossil fuel storage tank capacity \non the site in excess of the capacity that existed on August 31, 2022 is prohibited. \nAdding storage tank capacity exclusively for renewable fuels or to comply with \nthe Renewable Fuel Standard (PCC Chapter 16.60 Motor Vehicle Fuels) is not \nconsidered an increase in capacity. Storing coal on the site is prohibited.  \nb. New Bulk Fossil Fuel Terminals are prohibited. \nC. Conditional uses. Uses which are allowed if approved through the conditional use review \nprocess are listed in Table 140-1 with a \"CU\". These uses are allowed provided they comply \nwith the conditional use approval criteria for that use, the development standards, and \nother regulations of this Title. Uses listed with a \"CU\" that also have a footnote number in \nthe table are subject to the regulations cited in the footnote.

See Table 140-1.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-11 \nDevelopment Standards \n33.140.200 Lot Size \nLot size regulations are in Chapters 33.614 and 33.615. \n33.140.205 Floor Area Ratio \nA. Purpose. Floor area ratios (FARs) regulate the amount of use (the intensity) allowed on a \nsite. FARs provide a means to match the potential amount of uses with the desired \ncharacter of the area and the provision of public services. FARs also work with the height, \nsetback, and building coverage standards to control the overall bulk of development.  \nB. The floor area standards. The FARs are stated in Table 140-2. The FAR standards of plan \ndistricts supersede the FAR standards of this chapter. \nC. Bonus FAR. In the EX zone, bonus FAR is allowed as follows. Sites in the other employment \nand industrial zones are not eligible to use the bonus options. Adjustments to this \nSubsection, or to the maximum floor area allowed through the following bonuses, are \nprohibited:  \n1. Mandatory inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR is allowed up to the maximum FAR with \ninclusionary housing bonus stated in Table 140-2 for development that triggers the \nrequirements of 33.245, Inclusionary Housing. The amount of bonus floor area \nallowed is an amount equal to the net building area of the building that triggers \n33.245, up to the maximum FAR with bonus stated in Table 140-2. To qualify for this \nbonus, the applicant must provide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau \ncertifying that the regulations of 33.245 have been met. \n2. Voluntary inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR up to the maximum FAR with inclusionary \nhousing bonus stated in Table 140-2 is allowed when one of the following is met: \na. Bonus FAR is allowed for projects that voluntarily comply with the standards of \n33.245.040 and 33.245.050. The amount of bonus floor area allowed is an \namount equal to the net building area of the building that complies with \n33.245.040 and .050, up to the maximum FAR with bonus stated in Table 140-2. \nTo qualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a letter from the Portland \nHousing Bureau certifying that the regulations of 33.245 have been met. The \nletter is required to be submitted before a building permit can be issued for \ndevelopment, but is not required in order to apply for a land use review; or \nb. Bonus FAR is allowed in exchange for payment into the Affordable Housing Fund. \nFor each square foot of floor area purchased a fee must be paid to the Portland \nHousing Bureau (PHB). The Portland Housing Bureau collects and administers the \nAffordable Housing Fund, and determines the fee. PHB determines the fee per \nsquare foot and updates the fee at least every three years. The fee schedule is \navailable from Portland Permitting & Development. To qualify for this bonus, the \napplicant must provide a letter from PHB documenting the amount that has been \ncontributed. The letter is required to be submitted before a building permit can \nbe issued for development, but is not required in order to apply for a land use \nreview.  Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-12 \nD. Transfer of FAR from historic resources in the EX Zone. Floor area ratios may be \ntransferred from a site zoned EX that contains a Historic or Conservation Landmark or \ncontributing resource in a Historic or Conservation District as follows:  \n1. Maximum increase in FAR. An increase in FAR on the receiving site of more than 3 to 1 \nis prohibited. The total increased FAR includes FAR transferred from historic \nresources, and additional FAR allowed at the receiving site from bonus provisions, or \nfrom other transfers.   \n2. Development standards. The building on the receiving site must meet the \ndevelopment standards of the base zone, overlay zone, and plan district except floor \narea ratio, which is regulated by Subsection C; \n3. Receiving site. The transfer must be to a site that is: \na. Zoned C or EX; and \nb. Within the recognized neighborhood where the Historic or Conservation \nLandmark or contributing resource in a Historic or Conservation District is \nlocated, or to any site within two miles of the Historic or Conservation Landmark \nor contributing resource in a Historic or Conservation District; and \n4. The property owner executes a covenant with the City that is attached to and \nrecorded with the deed of both the site transferring and the site receiving the density \nreflecting the respective increase and decrease of potential FAR. The covenants for \nboth sites must meet the requirements of Section 33.700.060, Covenants with the \nCity.  \nE. Transfer of FAR from historic resources in the EG Zones. Floor area may be transferred \nfrom a site zoned EG1 or EG2 that contains a Historic or Conservation Landmark or \ncontributing resource in a Historic or Conservation District as follows: \n1. Maximum increase in FAR. An increase in FAR on the receiving site of more than 3 to 1 \nis prohibited. The total increased FAR includes FAR transferred from historic \nresources, and additional FAR allowed at the receiving site from bonus provisions, or \nfrom other transfers.   \n2. Development standards. The building on the receiving site must meet the \ndevelopment standards of the base zone, overlay zone, and plan district except floor \narea ratio, which is regulated by Subsection C; \n3. Receiving site. The transfer must be to a site that is: \na. Zoned EG1 or EG2; and \nb. Within the recognized neighborhood where the Historic or Conservation \nLandmark or contributing resource in a Historic or Conservation District is \nlocated, or to any site within two miles of the Historic or Conservation Landmark \nor contributing resource in a Historic or Conservation District; and \n4. The property owner executes a covenant with the City that is attached to and \nrecorded with the deed of both the site transferring and the site receiving the density \nreflecting the respective increase and decrease of potential FAR. The covenants for  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-13 \nboth sites must meet the requirements of Section 33.700.060, Covenants with the \nCity.  \n33.140.210 Height \nA. Purpose. The height standards work with the FAR, building setback, and building coverage \nstandards to control the overall bulk and intensity of an area. The EG1 zone height limit is \nthe same as the General Commercial zone because the EG1 zone often functions as a \ntransition zone between industrial and residential or commercial zones. The EX zone height \nlimit reflects its use in intense urban areas and the range of uses that are allowed. The \nother zones do not have height limits because tall buildings in these areas have \ntraditionally not been a problem. \nB. The height standard. The height limits for all structures, except detached accessory \nstructures, are stated in Table 140-2. The height standards for detached accessory \nstructures are stated in 33.140.270. Exceptions to the maximum height standard are  \nstated below. \n1. Projections allowed. Chimneys, flag poles, satellite receiving dishes, and other similar \nitems attached to a building, with a width, depth, or diameter of 5 feet or less may rise \n10 feet above the height limit, or 5 feet above the highest point of the roof, whichever \nis greater. If they are greater than 5 feet in width, depth, or diameter, they are subject \nto the height limit.  \n2. Parapets and rooftop railings may extend 4 feet above the height limit. \n3.  Rooftop mechanical equipment and stairwell enclosures that provide rooftop access \nmay extend above the height limit as follows, provided that the equipment and \nenclosures are set back at least 15 feet from all roof edges on street facing facades: \na. Elevator mechanical equipment may extend up to 16 feet above the height  \nlimit; and \nb. Other mechanical equipment and stairwell enclosures that cumulatively cover no \nmore than 10 percent of the roof area may extend up to 10 feet above the height \nlimit. \n4. Antennas, utility power poles, and public safety facilities are exempt from the  \nheight limit. \n5. Small wind turbines are subject to the standards of Chapter 33.299. \n6. Roof mounted solar panels are not included in height calculations, and may exceed \nthe maximum height limit if the following are met: \na. For flat roofs or the horizontal portion of mansard roofs, they may extend up to 5 \nfeet above the top of the highest point of the roof. \nb. For pitched, hipped, or gambrel roofs, they must be mounted no more than 12 \ninches from the surface of the roof at any point, and may not extend above the \nridgeline of the roof. The 12 inches is measured from the upper side of the  \nsolar panel.  \n  Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-14 \nTable 140-2 \nDevelopment Standards \n \nStandard \n \nEG1 \n \nEG2 \n \nEX  \n \nIG1 \n \nIG2 \n \nIH \nMaximum FAR  \n(see 33.140.205) \n3 to 1 3 to 1 3 to 1 no limit no limit no limit \nMaximum FAR with \nInclusionary Housing \nBonus \n(see 33.140.205.C) \nNA NA 5 to 1 NA NA NA \nMaximum Height  \n(see 33.140.210) \n45 ft. no limit 65 ft no limit no limit no limit \nMin.

The setback standards promote different streetscapes. The EG2 and IG2 zone \nsetbacks promote a spacious style of development. The EG1, IG1, and EX zone setbacks \nreflect the generally built-up character of these areas. The IH zone requires only a minimal \nsetback to separate uses from the street. The setback standards are also intended to \nensure that development will preserve light, air, and privacy for abutting residential zones. \nIn the EG1 and EX zones, the setback requirements along transit streets and in Pedestrian \nDistricts create an environment that is inviting to pedestrians and transit users. \nB. Minimum building setbacks. The setback standards apply to all buildings and structures on \nthe site except as specified in this section. Setbacks for exterior development are stated in \n33.140.245 below, and for parking areas in Chapter 33.266. \n1. Generally. The required building setbacks are stated in Table 140-2. \n2. Lot line abutting R-zoned lot, except RX. Building setbacks and required landscape \nbuffering on lot lines that abut lots in residential zones, except RX, are stated in Table \n140-3. Required landscaped areas must comply with at least the L3 standard as stated \nin Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening. Landscaping is not required where \nbuildings abut a lot line. \n3. Exceptions to the building setbacks. \na. Setback averaging. Outside of Pedestrian Districts and along non-transit streets, \nthe street setback from a street lot line for buildings, decks, balconies, and \nporches may be reduced to the average of the existing respective setbacks on \nabutting lots. See Chapter 33.930, Measurements, for more information. \nb. Split zoning. No setbacks are required from an internal lot line that is also a \nzoning line on sites with split zoning. \n4. Extensions into required building setbacks. \na. The following features of a building may extend into a required building setback \nup to 20 percent of the depth of the setback. However, except for building eaves, \nthey may not project into the landscape buffer required by Paragraph B.2.  \n(1) Eaves, chimneys, fireplace inserts and vents, mechanical equipment, fire \nescapes, water collection cisterns, and planters; \n(2) Decks, stairways, wheelchair ramps, and uncovered balconies not meeting \nthe standard of subparagraph B.4.b.; and \n(3) Bays and bay windows extending into the setback also must meet the \nfollowing requirements: \n• Each bay and bay window may be up to 12 feet long, but the total area \nof all bays and bay windows on a building facade cannot be more than \n30 percent of the area of the facade; \n• At least 30 percent of the area of the bay which faces the property line \nrequiring the setback must be glazing or glass block;  Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-16 \n• Bays and bay windows must cantilever beyond the foundation of the \nbuilding; and \n• The bay may not include any doors. \nb. The following minor features of a building are allowed to extend into required \nbuilding setbacks but may not project into the landscaped buffer required by \nParagraph B.2: \n(1) Canopies, marquees, awnings, and similar features may fully extend into a \nstreet setback; \n(2) Uncovered stairways and wheelchair ramps that lead to one entrance on \nthe street-facing facade of a building may fully extend into a street setback; \n(3) Uncovered decks, stairways, and wheelchair ramps that are no more than 2-\n1/2 feet above the ground may fully extend into a required building setback; \nand \n(4) On lots that slope down from the street, vehicular and pedestrian entry \nbridges that are no more than 2-1/2 feet above the average sidewalk \nelevation may fully extend into a required building setback. \n5. Detached accessory structures. For sites entirely in residential use, detached accessory \nstructures are subject to the multi-dwelling zone standards of 33.120.280. The setback \nstandards for detached accessory structures are stated in 33.140.270 below. Fences \nare addressed in 33.140.275 below.  \nC. Maximum building setbacks. \n1. Building setbacks on a transit street or in a Pedestrian District. The maximum setback \nstandards of this paragraph apply to buildings that are enclosed on all sides.  \na. Where these standards apply. Except as provided in Subsection D. below, these \nsetback standards apply to sites in the EG1 and EX zones. \nb. Measurement.  \n(1) Where an existing building is being altered, the standards of this paragraph \napply to the ground level, street-facing facade of the entire building. See \nFigures 140-1 and 140-2. \n(2) Where there is more than one building on the site, the standards of this \nparagraph apply to the combined ground level, street-facing facades of all of \nthe buildings on the site. See Figures 140-3 and 140-4. \n(3) For buildings where all of the floor area is in residential use, the street-\nfacing facade of an open porch that meets the following standards is \nincluded as part of the ground level, street-facing facade of the building: \n• For houses, attached houses, manufactured homes and duplexes, the \nporch must be at least 25 square feet in area. For multi-dwelling \nstructures, the porch must be at least 9 feet wide and 7 feet deep; \n• The porch must have at least one entrance facing the street; and \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-17 \n• The porch must have a roof that is: \n− No more than 12 feet above the floor of the porch; and \n− At least 30 percent solid. This standard may be met by having 30 \npercent of the porch area covered with a solid roof, or by having \nthe entire area covered with a trellis or other open material if no \nmore than 70 percent of the area of the material is open. \nc. Standards. There are two standards. Subparagraphs C.1.d. and e. specify where \neach standard applies: \n(1) Standard 1: At least 50 percent of the length of the ground level street-\nfacing facade of the building must be within the maximum setback; \n(2) Standard 2: 100 percent of the length of the ground level street-facing \nfacade of the building must be within the maximum setback; \nd. Outside a Pedestrian district. Where the site is not in a Pedestrian District: \n(1) One transit street. Where the site is adjacent to one transit street, the \nstandard of Standard 1 must be met on the transit street frontage; \n(2) Two non-intersecting transit streets. Where the site is adjacent to two \ntransit streets that do not intersect: \n• Standard 1 must be met on the frontage of the transit street with the \nhighest classification. If both streets have the same classification, the \napplicant may choose which street; \n• If one of the transit streets intersects a City Walkway, Standard 1 must \nbe met along both the transit street with the highest classification and \nthe City Walkway; \n(3) Two or more intersecting transit streets. Where the site is adjacent to two \nor more intersecting transit streets, Standard 2 must be met on the frontage \nof the transit street with the highest classification and Standard 1 must be \nmet on an intersecting transit street. If two streets have the same highest \nclassification, the applicant may choose which street. \n \n \n \ne. In a Pedestrian District. Where the site is in a Pedestrian District: \n(1) One street. Where the site is adjacent to only one street, Standard 1 must \nbe met on that street frontage; \n(2) Through lot with one transit street. Where the site is a through lot and one \nfrontage is a transit street and one is a non-transit street, Standard 1 must \nbe met on the frontage of the transit street; \n(3) Through lot with two transit streets. Where the site is a through lot and \nboth frontages are on transit streets, Standard 1 must be met on the \nfrontage of the transit street with the highest classification. If both streets \nhave the same classification, the applicant may choose which street;  Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-18 \n(4) Through lot with no transit streets. Where the site is a through lot and \nneither frontage is on a transit street, Standard 1 must be met on one of  \nthe frontages. The applicant may choose on which street to meet the \nstandard; \n(5) One transit street and one intersecting non-transit street. Where the site is \nadjacent to a transit street and an intersecting non-transit street, the \nfollowing standards must be met: \n• Standard 2 must be met on the frontage of the transit street, \n• Standard 1 must be met on the intersecting non-transit street; \n(6) Two or more intersecting transit streets. Where the site is adjacent to two \nor more intersecting transit streets, the following standards must be met on \nthe frontage of the transit street with the highest classification and any \nintersecting transit street: \n• Standard 2 must be met on the frontage of the transit street with the \nhighest classification. If both transit streets have the same classification, \nthe applicant may choose which street; and \n• Standard 1 must be met on an intersecting transit street; \n(7) Three or more frontages, two non-intersecting transit streets. Where the \nsite has three or more frontages, and two or them are transit streets that do \nnot intersect, the following standards must be met on the frontage of the \ntransit street with the highest classification and one intersecting street: \n• Standard 2 must be met on the frontage of the transit street with the \nhighest classification. If both transit streets have the same classification, \nthe applicant may choose which street; and \n• Standard 1 must be met on an intersecting street; \n(8) Two or more frontages, no transit streets, two or more intersecting streets. \nWhere the site has two or more frontages, none of them are transit streets, \nand two or more of the streets intersect, the following standards must be \nmet on the frontage of one street and one intersecting street: \n• Standard 2 must be met on the frontage of one street; and \n• Standard 1 must be met on an intersecting street. \n2. Exemption. The maximum building setbacks do not apply to primary structures under \n500 square feet in floor area, or to detached accessory structures. The street-facing \nfacades of detached accessory structures do not count towards meeting maximum \nsetback standards. See Figure 140-3.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-19 \nFigure 140-1 \nAlteration to Existing Building in Conformance with Maximum Setback Standard \n \nFigure 140-2 \nAlterations to Existing Building \n  Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-20 \nFigure 140-3 \nCalculating Maximum Building Setback When More Than One Building On Site \n \nFigure 140-4 \nNew Buildings on Sites with Buildings That Do Not Meet the Maximum Building Setback \n \nD. Alternative maximum setback option for large retailers.  \n1. Purpose. The intent of these regulations is to allow deeper street setbacks for very \nlarge retail stores locating along transit streets or in Pedestrian Districts in exchange  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-21 \nfor a pedestrian and transit-friendly main street type of development. These large \nretail sites can still be transit-supportive and pedestrian-friendly by placing smaller \ncommercial buildings close to the street and by creating an internal circulation system \nthat is similar to streets to separate the parking area into blocks. The intent is to \nencourage development that will, over time, form a pedestrian-friendly main street \nalong the perimeter of the parking blocks and provide connectivity within the site and \nto adjacent streets and uses. \n2. Regulation. Sites with a building having at least 100,000 square feet of floor area in \nRetail Sales And Service uses are exempt from the maximum setback requirement of \nTable 140-2 and the vehicle area frontage limitations of 33.266.130.C.3 if all of the \nrequirements of this paragraph are met. For sites with frontage on more than one \ntransit street or more than one street in a Pedestrian District, this exemption may be \nused only along one transit street frontage or frontage along a street in a  \nPedestrian District. \na. Other buildings on the site have ground level walls within the maximum setback \nfor at least 25 percent of the frontage on a transit street or street in a Pedestrian \nDistrict. These buildings must be constructed before or at the same time as the \nlarge retail store; \nb. Internal circulation system. An internal circulation system that meets the \nfollowing standards must be provided. \n(1) Internal accessways that are similar to streets must divide the site into \nparking areas that are no greater than 55,000 square feet; \n(2) These accessways must connect to the transit street, or street in a \nPedestrian District, at least every 250 feet;  \n(3) Each internal accessway must have at least one auto travel lane, curbs, and \nunobstructed sidewalks on both sides. One of the following must be met: \n• The sidewalks must be at least 10 feet wide and planted with trees a \nmaximum of 30 feet on center. Trees must be planted in the center of \nunpaved tree wells at least 18 square feet, with a minimum dimension \nof 3 feet. The unpaved area may be covered with a tree grate. Tree \nwells must be adjacent to the curb, and must be located so there is at \nleast 6 feet of unobstructed sidewalk; or \n• The sidewalks must be at least 6 feet wide. There must be a planting \nstrip at least 4 feet wide. The planting strip must be between the curb \nand the sidewalk, and be landscaped to at least the L1 standard except \nthat trees cannot be grouped. \n(4) Along each internal accessway that intersects a transit street, parking must \nbe provided between both sidewalks and the auto travel lanes except for \nwithin 75 feet of the transit street intersection, measured from the street \nlot line, where parking is not allowed; \n(5) Curb extensions that are at least the full depth of the parking must be \nprovided, as shown in Figure 140-5, at the intersections of internal \naccessways that have parking; and  Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-22 \n(6) The internal accessways are excluded from the portion of the parking and \nloading area used to calculate required interior landscaping. \nc. Connections between sites. This standard applies to all commercial, office, or \ninstitutional development that is adjacent to sites either developed for \ncommercial, office, or institutional use, or zoned C, E, or I. The system must \nconnect the buildings on the site to these adjacent sites. \nFigure 140-5 \nInternal Circulation System\n \n \n33.140.220 Building Coverage \nA. Purpose. The building coverage standards work with the FAR, height, and setback \nstandards to control the overall bulk of structures. The standards assure that taller \nbuildings will not have such a large footprint that their total bulk will overwhelm adjacent \ndevelopment or be inconsistent with the desired character of the zone. In the EG1, EG2,  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-23 \nand IG2 zones, the standards work to assure that buildings will not dominate areas they are \nin. There is no limit to building coverage in the EX and IG1 zones because of the existing \nbuilt-up character of the zones. There is no limit in the IH zone because the zone is \ndesigned to provide development flexibility. \nB. The building coverage standards. The maximum building coverage for a site is stated in \nTable 140-2. The building coverage limits apply to all buildings and covered structures. \n33.140.225 Landscaped Areas \nA. Purpose. Landscaping is required to help soften the effects of built and paved areas. \nLandscaping also helps cool the air temperature, intercept rainfall and reduce stormwater \nrunoff by providing non-paved permeable surface. Landscaping can also provide food for \npeople and habitat for birds and other wildlife. Landscaping is required for all employment \nand industrially zoned lands abutting R-zoned lands to provide buffering and promote the \nlivability of the residential lands. \nB. Minimum landscaped area standard. The required amounts of landscaped areas are stated \nin Table 140-2. Required landscaped areas must be at ground level and comply with at least \nthe L1 standard as stated in Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening. However, up to \none-third of the required landscaped area may be improved for active or passive \nrecreational use, or for use by pedestrians. Examples include walkways, play areas, plazas, \npicnic areas, and unenclosed recreational facilities. Any required landscaping, such as for \nrequired setbacks or parking lots, applies towards the landscaped area standard. \n33.140.227 Trees \nRequirements for street trees and for on-site tree preservation, protection, and overall tree density \nare in Title 11, Trees. See Chapter 11.50, Trees in Development Situations. \n33.140.230 Windows in the EX Zone \nA. Windows in street-facing facades. \n1.  Purpose. In the EX zone, this standard: \n• Ensures that there is a visual connection between activities occurring within a \nstructure and the street; \n• Enhances public safety by allowing people to survey their neighborhood from \ninside a structure; and \n• Provides a more pleasant pedestrian environment by preventing large expanses of \nblank facades along streets. \n2. Where this standard applies. This standard applies to street-facing facades of buildings \nin the EX zone. Where a proposal is for an alteration or addition to existing \ndevelopment, the applicant may choose to apply the standard either to the portion \nbeing altered or added, or to the entire street-facing facade.  \n3. Windows in street-facing facades. At least 15 percent of the area of each facade that \nfaces a street lot line must be windows or main entrance doors. Windows used to \nmeet this standard must allow views from the building to the street. Glass block does \nnot meet this standard. Windows in garage doors do not count toward meeting this  Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-24 \nstandard, but windows in garage walls do count toward meeting this standard. To \ncount toward meeting this standard a door must be at the main entrance and face the \nstreet lot line. For structures subject to ground floor window requirements, windows \nused to meet ground floor window requirements may also be used to meet this \nstandard. \n4. Exemption. Development on flag lots or on lots that slope up or down from the street \nwith an average slope of 20 percent or more are exempt from this standard. \nB. Ground floor windows. \n1. Purpose. In the EX zone, blank walls on the ground level of buildings are limited in \norder to: \n• Provide a pleasant, rich, and diverse pedestrian experience by connecting activities \noccurring within a structure to adjacent sidewalk areas, or allowing public art at \nthe ground level; \n• Encourage continuity of retail and service uses;  \n• Encourage surveillance opportunities by restricting fortress-like facades at street \nlevel; and  \n• Avoid a monotonous pedestrian environment.  \n2. Required amounts of window area. In the EX zone, all exterior walls on the ground \nlevel that are 20 feet or closer to a street lot line, sidewalk, plaza, or other public open \nspace or right-of-way must have windows. The windows must be at least 50 percent of \nthe length and 25 percent of the ground level wall area. For the purposes of this \nstandard, ground level wall areas include all exterior wall areas from 2 feet to 10 feet \nabove the finished grade. The requirement does not apply to the walls of residential \nunits, and does not apply to the walls of parking structures when set back at least 5 \nfeet and landscaped to at least the L2 standard. \n3. Qualifying window features. Required window areas must be either windows that \nallow views into working areas or lobbies, pedestrian entrances, or display windows \nset into the wall. Display cases attached to the outside wall do not qualify. The bottom \nof the windows must be no more than 4 feet above the adjacent exterior grade.  \n4. Exceptions for Public Arts. Outside of the Central City plan district, public art is allowed \ninstead of meeting the ground floor window provision. Covenants for the public art \nwill be required, following the regulations of Section 33.700.060, Covenants with the \nCity, to ensure the installation, preservation, maintenance, and replacement of the \npublic art. To qualify for this exception, documentation of approval by the City Arts \nProgram or its designee must be provided prior to approval of the building permit. \n33.140.235 Screening \nA. Purpose. The screening standards address specific unsightly features which detract from \nthe appearance of an area.  \nB. Garbage and recycling collection areas. In all zones except the IH zone, exterior garbage \ncans, garbage collection areas, and recycling collection areas must be screened from the  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-25 \nstreet and any adjacent properties. Screening must comply with at least the L3 or F2 \nstandards of Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening. \nC. Mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment located on the ground, such as heating or \ncooling equipment, pumps, or generators, must be screened from the street and any \nabutting residential zones by walls, fences, or vegetation. Screening must comply with at \nleast the L2 or F2 standards of Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening, and be tall \nenough to screen the equipment. Mechanical equipment placed on roofs must be screened \nin one of the following ways, if the equipment is within 50 feet of an R zone: \n1. A parapet along facades facing the R zone that is as tall as the tallest part of  \nthe equipment;  \n2. A screen around the equipment that is as tall as the tallest part of the  \nequipment; or \n3. The equipment is set back from roof edges facing the R zone 3 feet for each foot of \nheight of the equipment. \nD. Other screening requirements. The screening requirements for parking, exterior storage, \nand exterior display areas are stated with the regulations for those types  \nof development. \n33.140.240 Pedestrian Standards \nA. Purpose. The pedestrian standards encourage a safe, attractive, and usable pedestrian \ncirculation system in developments in the employment zones. They ensure a direct \npedestrian connection between abutting streets and buildings on the site, and between \nbuildings and other activities within the site. In addition, they provide for connections \nbetween adjacent sites, where feasible. \nB. The standards. The standards of this section apply to all development in the EG1, EG2, and \nEX zones except houses, attached houses, and duplexes. An on-site pedestrian circulation \nsystem must be provided. The system must meet all standards of this subsection.  \n1. Connections. The on-site pedestrian circulation system must provide connections as \nspecified below: \na. Connection between streets and entrances.  \n(1) Sites with one street frontage.  \nGenerally. There must be a connection between one main entrance of \neach building on the site and the adjacent street. The connection may \nnot be more than 20 feet longer or 120 percent of the straight line \ndistance, whichever is less.  \n• Household Living. Sites where all of the floor area is in Household Living \nuses are only required to provide a connection to one main entrance on \nthe site. The connection may not be more than 20 feet longer or 120 \npercent of the straight line distance, whichever is less. \n• Tree preservation. If a tree that is at least 12 inches in diameter is \nproposed for preservation, and the location of the tree or its root \nprotection zone would prevent the standard of this paragraph from  Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-26 \nbeing met, the connection may be up to 200 percent of the straight  \nline distance.  \n(2) Sites with more than one street frontage. Where the site has more than one \nstreet frontage, the following must be met: \n• The standard of B.1.a(1) must be met to connect the main entrance of \neach building on the site to the closest sidewalk or roadway if there are \nno sidewalks. Sites where all of the floor area is in Household Living uses \nare only required to provide a connection meeting the standard of \nB.1.a(1) to one main entrance on the site; \n• An additional connection, which does not have to be a straight line \nconnection, is required between each of the other streets and a \npedestrian entrance. However, if at least 50 percent of a street facing \nfacade is within 10 feet of the street, no connection is required to  \nthat street. \nb. Internal connections. The system must connect all main entrances on the site, \nand provide connections to other areas of the site, such as parking areas, bicycle \nparking, recreational areas, common outdoor areas, and any  \npedestrian amenities. \n2. Materials.  \na. The circulation system must be hard-surfaced, and be at least 6 feet wide.  \nb. Where the system crosses driveways, parking areas, and loading areas, the \nsystem must be clearly identifiable, through the use of elevation changes, speed \nbumps, a different paving material, or other similar method. Striping does not \nmeet this requirement. Elevation changes and speed bumps must be at least 4 \ninches high. \nc. Where the system is parallel and adjacent to an auto travel lane, the system \nmust be a raised path or be separated from the auto travel lane by a raised curb, \nbollards, landscaping or other physical barrier. If a raised path is used it must be \nat least 4 inches high and the ends of the raised portions must be equipped with \ncurb ramps. Bollard spacing must be no further apart than 5 feet on center. \n3. Lighting. The on-site pedestrian circulation system must be lighted to a level where \nthe system can be used at night by the employees, residents, and customers. \n4. EG1 and EX zones. The land between a building and a street lot line must be \nlandscaped to at least the L1 level and/or hard-surfaced for use by pedestrians. This \narea may be counted towards any minimum landscaped area requirements. Vehicle \nareas and exterior display, storage, and work activities, if allowed, are exempt from \nthis standard. Bicycle parking may be located in the area between a building and a \nstreet lot line when the area is hard-surfaced. \n33.140.242 Transit Street Main Entrance \nA. Purpose. Locating the main entrance to a use on a transit street provides convenient \npedestrian access between the use and public sidewalks and transit facilities, and so \npromotes walking and the use of transit.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-27 \nB. Applicability.  \n1. Generally. In the EX and EG1 zones, all sites with at least one frontage on a transit \nstreet, and where any of the floor area on the site is in nonresidential uses, must meet \nthe following standards for the nonresidential uses. If the site has frontage on more \nthan one transit street, the standards of Subsection C, below, must be met on at least \none of the transit streets; \n2. Small housing types. Houses, attached houses, manufactured homes, duplexes, \nattached duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes must meet the standards of subsection \n33.140.265.D, Residential Main Entrance, instead of the requirements of this section.  \nC. Location. For the portion of buildings that conform to the maximum building setback, at \nleast one main entrance for each nonresidential tenant space on the ground floor must \nmeet the standards of this section. The ground floor is the lowest floor of the building that \nis within four feet of the adjacent transit street grade. The main entrance must: \n1. Be within 25 feet of the transit street;  \n2. Allow pedestrians to both enter and exit the building; and \n3. Either: \na. Face the transit street; or \nb. Be at an angle of up to 45 degrees from the transit street, measured from the \nstreet property line, as shown in Figure 140-6. \nD. Unlocked during regular business hours. The main entrance that meets the standards of \nSubsection C must be unlocked during regular business hours.  Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-28 \nFigure 140-6 \nTransit Street Main Entrance \n \n33.140.245 Exterior Display, Storage, and Work Activities \nA. Purpose. The exterior development standards of this section are intended to assure that \nexterior display, storage, and work activities: \n• Will be consistent with the desired character of the zone; \n• Will not be a detriment to the overall appearance of an employment or industrial area, \nand exterior activities in the EG1 zone will be limited to a similar level as exterior \nactivities in the Commercial Employment zone;  \n• Will not have adverse impacts on adjacent properties, especially those zoned \nresidential; and  \n• Will not have an adverse impact on the environment. \nB. Exterior display.  \n1. Employment zones. Exterior display of goods is allowed as follows. The setback and \nlandscaping standards for exterior display areas are stated in Table 140-4:  \na. Exterior display of goods is allowed in the EG1 zone except for uses in the \nIndustrial categories. Exterior display of goods is not allowed for uses in the \nIndustrial categories in the EG1 zone.  \nb. Exterior display of goods is allowed in the EG2 zone.  \nc. Exterior display of goods is allowed in the EX zone except for the display of motor \nvehicles, recreational vehicles, motor vehicle parts and supplies, building \nmaterials, and goods associated with an industrial use.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-29 \n2. Industrial zones. Exterior display of goods is allowed in the I zones. The setback and \nlandscaping standards for exterior display areas are stated in Table 140-4. \nC. Exterior storage.  \n1. Employment zones. Exterior storage is allowed in the EG1 zones but is limited to 20 \npercent of the site area for all uses except lumber yards and other building material \nstores. Exterior storage is allowed in the EG2 zones. Exterior storage is not allowed in \nthe EX zones. The setback and landscaping standards for exterior storage areas are \nstated in Table 140-4. \n2. Industrial zones. Exterior storage is allowed in the I zones. The setback and \nlandscaping standards for exterior storage areas area stated in Table 140-4. \nD. Exterior work activities. Exterior work activities are allowed in the industrial zones but not \nthe employment zones. The setback and landscaping standards for exterior activity areas \nare stated in Table 140-4. \nE. Other exterior activities. Outdoor eating areas are allowed as an exterior activity in the \nemployment and industrial zones. \nF. Paving. All exterior development areas in the EG1, EX, and IG1 zones must be paved.

The regulations do not apply to pick-up and delivery activities, or to the use of vehicles \nduring construction, or other service at the site which occurs on an intermittent and short-term \nbasis. The truck categories are defined in Chapter 33.910. \nA. Light and medium trucks. The parking of light and medium trucks and similar equipment is \nallowed in areas that meet the perimeter development standards for parking areas. The \nareas must be paved.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-31 \nB. Heavy trucks. The parking of heavy trucks and similar equipment is allowed in zones that \nallow exterior storage. The development standards for exterior storage must be met in the \narea where the heavy trucks and similar equipment are parked.  \n33.140.255 Drive-Through Facilities \nDrive-through facilities are allowed in the zones which are intended for auto- accommodating \ndevelopment. They are not consistent with or supportive of areas where the desired character is \npedestrian-oriented development. The standards for drive-through facilities are stated in Chapter \n33.224, Drive-Through Facilities. \nA. EG and I zones. Drive-through facilities are allowed in the EG and I zones. \nB. EX zone. Drive-through facilities are prohibited in the EX zone. \n33.140.265 Residential Development \nWhen allowed, residential development is subject to the following development standards:  \nA. Generally. Except as specified in this section, base zone development standards continue \nto apply;  \nB. Existing buildings. Residential uses in existing buildings have no density limit within  \nthe building; \nC. New development. Residential uses in new development are subject to the development \nstandards of the EX zone, except as specified in this section; \nD. Residential main entrance.  \n1. Purpose. The main entrance standards serve several purposes: \n•  The main entrance standards, together with the window and garage standards \nensure that there is a physical and visual connection between the living area of \nthe residence and the street;  \n•  They enhance public safety for residents and visitors and provide opportunities \nfor community interaction;  \n•  They ensure that the pedestrian entrance is visible or clearly identifiable from \nthe street by its orientation or articulation; and \n•  They ensure that pedestrians can easily find the main entrance, and so establish \nhow to enter the residence. \n•  Ensure a connection to the public realm for development on lots fronting both \nprivate and public streets by making the pedestrian entrance visible or clearly \nidentifiable from the public street. \n2. Where these standards apply.  \na. The standards of this subsection apply to houses, attached houses, manufactured \nhomes, duplexes, attached duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes in the \nemployment and industrial zones.   Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-32 \nb. Where a proposal is for an alteration or addition to existing development, the \nstandards of this section apply only to the portion being altered or added.  \nc. On sites with frontage on both a private street and a public street, the standards \napply to the site frontage on the public street. On all other sites with more than \none street frontage, the applicant may choose on which frontage to meet the \nstandards. \nd. Development on flag lots or on lots which slope up or down from the street with \nan average slope of 20 percent or more are exempt from these standards. \n3. Location. At least one main entrance for each strucutre must: \na. Be within 8 feet of the longest street-facing wall of the structure; and \nb. Either: \n(1) Face the street. See Figure 140-7; \n(2) Be at an angle of up to 45 degrees from the street; or \n(3) Open onto a porch. See Figure 140-8. The porch must: \n• Be at least 25 square feet in area; \n• Have at least one entrance facing the street; and \n• Have a roof that is: \n− No more than 12 feet above the floor of the porch; and \n− At least 30 percent solid. This standard may be met by having 30 \npercent of the porch area covered with a solid roof, or by having \nthe entire area covered with lattice or other open material if no \nmore than 70 percent of the area of the material is open.  \n4. Duplexes on corner lots. Where a duplex is on a corner lot, the requirements of \nParagraph C.3, above, must be met for both dwelling units. Both main entrances may \nface the same street. \nE. Street-facing facades.  \n1. Purpose. The standard: \n•  Together with the main entrance and garage standards, ensures that there is a \nvisual connection between the living area of the residence and the street; \n•  Enhances public safety by allowing people to survey their neighborhood from \ninside their residences; and \n•  Provides a more pleasant pedestrian environment by preventing large expanses \nof blank facades along streets.  \n2. Where this standard applies. The standard of this subsection applies to houses, \nattached houses, manufactured homes, duplexes, attached duplexes, triplexes, and \nfourplexes in the Employment and Industrial zones. Where a proposal is for an \nalteration or addition to existing development, the applicant may choose to apply the \nstandard either to the portion being altered or added, or to the entire street-facing  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.140 \n3/1/25 Employment and Industrial Zones \n \n140-33 \nfacade. Development on flag lots or on lots that slope up or down from the street with \nan average slope of 20 percent or more are exempt from this standard. \n3. The standard. At least 15 percent of the area of each facade that faces a street lot line \nmust be windows or main entrance doors. Windows used to meet this standard must \nallow views from the building to the street. Glass block does not meet this standard. \nWindows in garage doors do not count toward meeting this standard, but windows in \ngarage walls do count toward meeting this standard. To count toward meeting this \nstandard, a door must be at the main entrance and facing a street lot line. \nFigure 140-7 \nMain Entrance Facing the Street \n \nFigure 140-8 \nMain Entrance Opening Onto a Porch \n  Chapter 33.140 Title 33, Planning and Zoning  \nEmployment and Industrial Zones  3/1/25  \n \n140-34 \nF.

The zones are for institutions such as medical centers \nand colleges that have been developed as campuses, and for other uses that are compatible with \nsurrounding neighborhoods. The differences between the zones reflect the diversity and location of \ncampus institutions. Allowed uses and development standards promote the desired character of each  Chapter 33.150 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCampus Institutional Zones 3/1/25 \n150-2 \nzone, and reflect the character and development intensity of surrounding neighborhoods. The CI1 and IR \nzones encourage development that is at a low to medium density residential scale, while the CI2 zone \nencourages development that is at a more intense, urban scale. The development standards allow \nflexibility for development and provide guidance to property owners, developers, and neighbors about \nthe limits of what is allowed. \n33.150.020 List of the Campus Institutional Zones \nThe full and short names of the campus institutional zones and their map symbols are listed below. \nWhen this Title refers to the campus institutional zones, it is referring to the three zones listed here. \nWhen this Title refers to the CI zones, it is referring only to CI1 and CI2.  \nFull Name Short Name/Map Symbol \nCampus Institutional 1 CI1 \nCampus Institutional 2 CI2 \nInstitutional Residential IR \n33.150.030 Characteristics of the Zones \nA. Campus Institutional 1 zone. The Campus Institutional 1 (CI1) zone is intended for large \ncolleges and medical centers located in or near low and medium density residential \nneighborhoods. Retail Sales and Service and other uses that serve or support the campus and \nneighborhood are allowed. Development is intended to be internally focused and compatible \nwith the scale of the surrounding neighborhood. Setback and open space requirements create \na buffer between the institution and the surrounding community. \nB. Campus Institutional 2 zone. The Campus Institutional 2 (CI2) zone is intended for large \nmedical centers, colleges and universities located in or near a Regional, Town or Neighborhood \nCenter, or along a civic or neighborhood corridor that is served by frequent transit service. \nDevelopment is intended to be pedestrian-oriented and at a scale that encourages urban-scale \nmedical and educational facilities, while also ensuring compatibility with nearby mixed-use \ncommercial and residential areas. Retail Sales and Service and Office uses are allowed to \nsupport the medical or college campus, and to provide services to the surrounding \nneighborhoods. \nC. IR zone. The IR zone is a multi-use zone that provides for the establishment and growth of large \ninstitutional campuses as well as higher density residential development. The IR zone \nrecognizes the valuable role of institutional uses in the community. However, these institutions \nare generally in residential areas where the level of public services is scaled to a less intense \nlevel of development. Institutional uses are often of a significantly different scale and character \nthan the areas in which they are located. Intensity and density are regulated by the maximum \nnumber of dwelling units per acre and the maximum size of buildings permitted. Some \ncommercial and light industrial uses are allowed, along with major event entertainment \nfacilities and other uses associated with institutions. \n \nResidential development allowed includes all structure types. Mixed use projects including \nboth residential development and institutions are allowed as well as single use projects that are \nentirely residential or institutional. IR zones will be located near one or more streets that are \ndesignated as District Collector streets, Transit Access Streets, or streets of higher classification \nThe IR zone will be applied only when it is accompanied by the Design overlay zone.

Regulations for other institutions. Schools, Colleges, Hospitals, and Medical Centers \nare allowed as a conditional use only. \nd. Regulations for recreational fields for organized sports. Recreational fields used for \norganized sports on a school, school site, or in a park, are subject to the regulations \nof Chapter 33.279, Recreational Fields for Organized Sports.  \n12. Daycare in the IR zone. This regulation applies to all parts of Table 150-1 that have a note \n[11]. Daycare facilities are allowed if included in the institution’s approved impact \nmitigation plan or conditional use master plan. \nC. Conditional uses. Uses that are allowed if approved through the conditional use review process \nare listed in Table 150-1 with a \"CU\". These uses are allowed provided they comply with the \nconditional use approval criteria for that use, the development standards, and other \nregulations of this Title. Uses listed with a \"CU\" that also have a footnote number in the table \nare subject to the regulations cited in the footnote. In addition, a use or development listed in \nthe 200s series of chapters is also subject to the regulations of those chapters. The conditional \nuse review process and approval criteria are stated in Chapter 33.815, Conditional Uses.  \nD. Prohibited uses. Uses listed in Table 150-1 with an \"N\" are prohibited. Existing uses in \ncategories listed as prohibited may be subject to the regulations of Chapter 33.258, \nNonconforming Uses and Development.  Chapter 33.150 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCampus Institutional Zones 3/1/25 \n150-8 \n33.150.110 Accessory Uses \nUses that are accessory to a primary use are allowed if they comply with specific regulations for the \naccessory use and all applicable development standards.

Creation of new lots is subject to the regulations of Chapter 33.613, Lots in \nCommercial and Campus Institutional Zones.  \n33.150.205 Floor Area Ratio \nA. Purpose. Floor area ratios (FARs) regulate the amount of use (the intensity) allowed on a site. \nFARs provide a means to match the potential amount of uses with the desired character of the \narea and the provision of public services. FARs also work with the height, setback, and building \ncoverage standards to control the overall bulk of development.  \nB. FAR standard. The floor area ratios are stated in Table 150-2 and apply to all development. \nC.  Inclusionary housing bonus FAR. The following FAR bonus options are allowed in the CI2 zone. \nSites in the CI1 and IR zone are not eligible for the bonus FAR options. Adjustments to this \nSubsection, or to the amount of maximum floor area allowed through the bonuses, are \nprohibited. \n1. Mandatory inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR is allowed up to the maximum FAR allowed \nwith inclusionary housing bonus stated in Table 150-2 for development that triggers the \nrequirements of 33.245, Inclusionary Housing. The amount of bonus floor area allowed is  Chapter 33.150 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCampus Institutional Zones 3/1/25 \n150-10 \nan amount equal to the net building area of the building that triggers 33.245, up to the \nmaximum FAR allowed with bonus stated in Table 150-2. To qualify for this bonus, the \napplicant must provide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the \nregulations of 33.245 have been met.  \n2. Voluntary inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR up to the maximum with inclusionary housing \nbonus stated in Table 150-2 is allowed when one of the following voluntary bonus options \nis met: \na. Bonus density or FAR is allowed for projects that voluntarily comply with the \nstandards of 33.245.040 and 33.245.050. The amount of bonus floor area allowed is \nan amount equal to the net building area of the building that complies with \n33.245.040 and .050, up to the maximum FAR allowed with bonus stated in Table \n150-2. To qualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a letter from the Portland \nHousing Bureau certifying that the regulations of 33.245 have been met. The letter is \nrequired to be submitted before a building permit can be issued for development, \nbut is not required in order to apply for a land use review; or \nb. Affordable Housing Fund. Bonus FAR is allowed in exchange for payment into the \nAffordable Housing Fund. For each square foot of floor area purchased a fee must be \npaid to the Portland Housing Bureau (PHB). The Portland Housing Bureau collects and \nadministers the Affordable Housing Fund, and determines the fee. PHB determines \nthe fee per square foot and updates the fee at least every three years. The fee \nschedule is available from the Bureau of Development Services. To qualify for this \nbonus, the applicant must provide a letter from PHB documenting the amount that \nhas been contributed. The letter is required to be submitted before a building permit \ncan be issued for development, but is not required in order to apply for a land use \nreview. \n33.150.210 Height \nA. Purpose. Maximum height limits work with other development standards to control the overall \nscale of buildings. The height limits in the CI zones allow for urban scale development that \ngenerally reflects the intent of each zone. Height limits adjacent to residential and mixed use \nareas preserve light, air, and the potential for privacy in the adjacent zones, and discourage \nbuildings that visually dominate adjacent development.  \nB. Maximum height. The maximum height standards for all structures are stated in Table 150-2, \nor are shown on Maps 150-1 through 150-4. Maximum height is reduced adjacent to certain \nzones as described in Subsection C. The maximum heights shown on Maps 150-1 through 150-4 \nsupersede the maximum height standards in Table 150-2 and Subsection C. Exceptions to all \nthe maximum height standards are stated in Subsection E. \nC. Reduced maximum height. Maximum height is reduced adjacent to certain zones.  \n1. In the CI1 zone, maximum height is reduced as follows.  \na. On the portion of the site within 60 feet of a lot line abutting or across the street \nfrom a site zoned OS or RF through R2.5, the maximum height is 30 feet. See Figure \n150-1.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.150 \n3/1/25 Campus Institutional Zones \n150-11 \nb.  On the portion of the site within 40 feet of a lot line abutting or across the street \nfrom a site zoned RM1 through RMP or commercial/mixed use zones the maximum \nheight is 45 feet. See Figure 150-2. \n2.  CI2 zone. \na.  Maximum height is reduced on sites in the CI2 zone that abut or are across the street \nfrom a site zoned OS, or RF through R2.5 as follows:  \n(1)  On the portion of the site within 60 feet of a lot line abutting or across the \nstreet from a site zoned OS, or RF through R2.5, the maximum height is 30 feet. \nSee Figure 150-1. \n(2)  On the portion of the site that is more than 60 feet but within 130 feet of a lot \nline abutting or across the street from a site zoned OS, or RF through R2.5, the \nmaximum height is 75 feet. See Figure 150-1. \nb.  Maximum height is reduced on sites in the CI2 zone that abut or are across the street \nfrom a site zoned RM1 through RMP, or commercial/mixed use zones as follows:  \n(1)  On the portion of the site within 40 feet of a lot line abutting or across the \nstreet from a site zoned RM1 through RMP, or commercial/mixed use zones, the \nmaximum height is 45 feet. See Figure 150-2. \n(2)  On the portion of the site more than 40 feet but within 110 feet of a lot line \nabutting or across the street from a site zoned RM1 through RMP, or \ncommercial/mixed use zones, the maximum height is 75 feet. See Figure 150-2. \nFigure 150-1 \n \n Chapter 33.150 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCampus Institutional Zones 3/1/25 \n150-12 \nFigure 150-2 \nD. Exceptions  \n1. Chimneys, flag poles, satellite receiving dishes, and other items similar with a width, \ndepth, or diameter of 5 feet or less may extend 10 feet above the height limit, or 5 feet \nabove the highest point of the roof, whichever is greater. If they are greater than 5 feet in \nwidth, depth, or diameter, they are subject to the height limit. \n2. Parapets and rooftop railings may extend 4 feet above the height limit. \n3. Rooftop mechanical equipment and stairwell enclosures that provide rooftop access may \nextend above the height limit as follows, provided that the equipment and enclosures are \nset back at least 15 feet from all roof edges on street facing facades: \na. Elevator mechanical equipment may extend up to 16 feet above the height  \nlimit; and \nb. Other mechanical equipment and stairwell enclosures that cumulatively cover no \nmore than 10 percent of the roof area may extend up to 10 feet above the height \nlimit. \n4. Antennas, utility power poles, and public safety facilities are exempt from the height limit. \n5. Small wind turbines are subject to the standards of Chapter 33.299. Roof mounted solar \npanels are not included in height calculations, any may exceed the maximum height limit if \nthe following are met: \na. For flat roofs or the horizontal portion of mansard roofs, they may extend up to 5 \nfeet above the top of the highest point of the roof. \nb. For pitched, hipped, or gambrel roofs, they must be mounted no more than 12 \ninches from the surface of the roof at any point, and may not extend above the \nridgeline of the roof. The 12 inches is measured from the upper side of the solar \npanel. \n6. Towers and spires with a footprint of 200 square feet or less may exceed the height limit, \nbut still must comply with the setback standard. \n \n \n Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.150 \n3/1/25 Campus Institutional Zones \n150-13 \nTable 150-2 \nSummary of Development Standards in Campus Institutional Zones \n \nStandard \n \nCI1 \n \nCI2 \n \nIR \nMaximum FAR [1] \n(see 33.150.205) \n \n0.5 to 1 \n \n3 to 1 [2] [3] \n \n2 to 1 \nMaximum FAR with Inclusionary Housing Bonus [1] \n(see 33.150.205.C) \nNA 3.75 to 1 [2] \n[3] \nNA \nMaximum Height \n(see 33.150.210) \n \n75 ft.

In this case, \nFAR is calculated based on the total square footage of the parcels within the zone rather than for each individual \nparcel, and setbacks, building length, facade articulation, ground floor windows and transit street ma in entrance \nregulations are measured from, or only apply to, the perimeter of the zone.  \n[2] Maximum FAR within the Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital and Health Center campus boundary shown on Map \n150-3 is 3.7 to 1, and is 4.5 to 1 with inclusionary housing bonus . \n[3] Maximum FAR within the PCC Sylvania campus boundary shown on Map 150 -5 is .75 to 1, and is 1 to 1 with \ninclusionary housing bonus. \n[4] Heights reduced on sites that are across the street from, or adjacent to, certain zones. See 33.150.210.C.  \n[5] For frontages where the maximum building setback applies, there is no minimum setback.   Chapter 33.150 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCampus Institutional Zones 3/1/25 \n150-14 \n \n33.150.215 Setbacks \nA. Purpose. The required building setbacks promote streetscapes that are consistent with the \ndesired character of the campus institutional zones, and reflect the diversity of neighborhoods \nwithin which the campus institutional zones are located. In instances where a campus \ninstitutional zone abuts a residential zone, the required setbacks centers complement the \nresidential character of surrounding neighborhood and result in development that will maintain \nlight, air, and the potential for privacy for adjacent residential zones. In instances where a \ncampus institutional zone abuts a mixed-use zone, pedestrian district and/or transit street, the \nsetback requirements promote buildings and activity that are inviting to pedestrians, and \ncontribute to an active pedestrian environment. \nB. Minimum building setbacks. The minimum building setback standards apply to all buildings \nand structures on the site. Minimum required building setbacks are stated in Table 150-2, or \nare shown on Maps 150-1 through 150-5. Minimum building setbacks shown on Maps 150-1 \nthrough 150--5 supersede Table 150-2. Exceptions to the minimum building setback standards \nare stated below: \n1. Minor projections allowed. Minor features of a building, such as eaves, chimneys, fire \nescapes, water collection cisterns and planters, bay windows, uncovered stairways, \nwheelchair ramps, and uncovered decks or balconies, may project into a required building \nsetback up to 20 percent of the depth of the setback. However, they may not be within 3 \nfeet of a lot line. Bays and bay windows extending into the setback also must meet the \nfollowing requirements: \na. Each bay and bay window may be up to 12 feet long, but the total area of all bays \nand bay windows on a building facade cannot be more than 30 percent of the area of  \nthe facade; \nb. At least 30 percent of the area of the bay which faces the property line requiring the \nsetback must be glazing or glass block; \nc. Bays and bay windows must cantilever beyond the foundation of the building; and \nd. The bay may not include any doors. \n2. Full projection allowed. In addition to Paragraph 1 above, the following features are \nallowed to fully project into required building setbacks: \na. Canopies, marquees, awnings, and similar features may fully extend into a street \nsetback; \nb. Uncovered stairways and wheelchair ramps that lead to one entrance on the street-\nfacing facade of a building may fully extend into a street setback; \nc. Uncovered decks and stairways that are no more than 2-1/2 feet above the ground \nmay fully extend into a required building setback; and \nd. On lots that slope down from the street, vehicular and pedestrian entry bridges that \nare no more than 2-1/2 feet above the average sidewalk elevation may fully extend \ninto a required building setback.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.150 \n3/1/25 Campus Institutional Zones \n150-15 \n3. Projections not allowed. Attached mechanical structures such as heat pumps, air \nconditioners, emergency generators, and water pumps are allowed in a street setback but \nnot a required setback from an abutting residential zone. \nC. Maximum building setbacks in the CI2 and IR zones.  \n1. Where the building is within 100 feet a transit street or street lot line within a pedestrian \ndistrict, the maximum the building can be set back is 10 feet. Where an existing building is \nbeing altered, the standard applies to the portion of the building being altered. If the site \nhas street lot lines on three or more streets, the maximum setback standard only applies \nto two of the streets. When this occurs, the standard must be applied to the streets with \nthe highest transit street classifications. If multiple streets have the same highest transit \nstreet classification, the applicant may choose which streets to apply the standard. \n2. Exception. The maximum building setbacks do not apply to primary structures under 500 \nsquare feet in floor area, or to detached accessory structures. The street-facing facades of \ndetached accessory structures do not count towards meeting maximum setback standard.  \nD. Improvements within maximum building setbacks. At least 50 percent of the setback area \nbetween the street lot line and the portion of the building that complies with the maximum \nbuilding setback must be hard surfaced for use by pedestrians. Residential buildings are exempt \nfrom this standard. \n33.150.220 Building Coverage \nA. Purpose. The building coverage standards limit the footprint of buildings and work with the \nFAR, height, and setback standards to control the overall scale of development. The standards \npromote development consistent with the desired character of the zone. In the CI1 zone, the \nstandard promotes open spaces, both formal and informal, together with buildings at a scale \nthat are compatible with surrounding single family residential development. In the CI2 zone the \nstandards allow for buildings that represent an urban level of development and are consistent \nwith adjacent mixed use zones.  \nB. Building coverage standards. The maximum building coverage covered structures are stated in \nTable 150-2 \n33.150.235 Building Length in the CI1 Zone \nA. Purpose. The maximum building length standard, along with the height and setback standard, \nlimits the amount of bulk that can be placed close to the street. The standard assures that long \nbuilding walls close to streets will be broken up into separate buildings. This will provide a \nfeeling of transition from lower density development and help create the desired character of \ndevelopment in these zones. \nB. Maximum building length. In the CI1 Zone, the maximum building length for the portion of \nbuildings located within 30 feet of a street lot line is 200 feet. The portions of buildings subject \nto this standard must be separated by a minimum of 20 feet when located on the same site. \n33.150.240 Landscaped Areas \nA. Purpose. Landscaping is attractive and it helps to soften the effects of built and paved areas. \nLandscaping also helps cool the air temperature, intercept rainfall and reduce stormwater \nrunoff by providing non-paved permeable surface. Landscaping is required for all campus  Chapter 33.150 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCampus Institutional Zones 3/1/25 \n150-16 \ninstitutional zoned lands that abut or are across a street from residential zoned lands to \nprovide buffering and promote the livability of the residential lands. \nB. Minimum landscaped area. The required amount of landscaped areas is stated in Table 150-2. \nRequired landscaped areas must be at ground level and comply with at least the L1 standard as \nstated in Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening. However, up to one-third of the required \nlandscaped area may be improved for active or passive recreational use, or for use by \npedestrians. Examples include walkways, play areas, plazas, picnic areas, and unenclosed \nrecreational facilities. Any required landscaping, such as for required setbacks or parking lots, \napplies towards the landscaped area standard. \nC. Landscaping required in minimum building setbacks. Landscaping is required in minimum \nbuilding setbacks from lot lines abutting or across the street from a residential zoned lot. The \ndepth and type of required landscaping are stated in Table 150-2.  \n33.150.245 Trees \nRequirements for street trees and for on-site tree preservation, protection, and overall tree density are \nspecified in Title 11. See Chapter 11.50, Trees in Development Situations. \n33.150.250 Ground Floor Windows in the CI2 and IR Zones. \nA. Purpose. In the CI2 and IR zones, blank walls on the ground level of buildings are limited in \norder to: \n• Provide a pleasant, rich, and diverse pedestrian experience by connecting activities \noccurring within a structure to adjacent sidewalk areas, or allowing public art at the ground \nlevel; \n• Encourage continuity of active street level uses;  \n• Encourage surveillance opportunities by restricting fortress-like facades at street  \nlevel; and  \n• Avoid a monotonous pedestrian environment.  \nB. Ground floor window standard. The following standards apply in the CI2 and IR zones: \n1. General standard.  \na. Windows must cover at least 40 percent of the ground floor wall area of street-facing \nfacades that are 20 feet or closer to a street lot line or a publicly-accessible plaza. For \nthe purposes of this standard, ground floor wall areas include all exterior wall areas \nfrom 2 feet to 10 feet above the finished grade, and include openings in the walls of \nstructured parking. See Figure 150-3.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.150 \n3/1/25 Campus Institutional Zones \n150-17 \nFigure 150-3 \nGround Floor Windows \n \nb. If the lot has more than one street frontage, then the ground floor window standard \nin Subparagraph B.1.a. applies to the facade that faces the highest transit street \nclassification. All other ground level street-facing facades that are 20 feet or closer to \nthe street lot line must have windows that cover 25 percent of the ground level wall \narea. The walls of structured parking along these facades may be set back at least 5 \nfeet and landscaped to the L2 standard instead of providing 25 percent windows. If \ntwo or more streets have the same highest transit street classification, then the \napplicant may choose on which of those streets to meet the higher standard. Transit \nstreet classifications are identified in the Transportation Element of the \nComprehensive Plan.  \n2. Exemptions:  \na. Houses, attached houses, manufactured homes, duplexes, attached duplexes, and \ntriplexes are exempt from this Section;  \nb. Ground floor street-facing walls of dwelling units are exempt from Paragraph B.1., \nbut the walls must meet one of the standards in Subsection D; and \nc. If the portion of the ground floor wall area that is not a dwelling unit is less than 250 \nsquare feet in area, then it is exempt from this Section. \nC. Qualifying window features. Required ground floor window areas must be windows that allow \nviews into working areas, lobbies, residential units or residential building common areas; \nglazing in pedestrian entrances; or display windows that are at least 24 inches deep set into a \nwall. Windows into storage areas, vehicle parking areas, mechanical and utility equipment \nareas, garbage and recycling areas, and display cases attached to outside walls do not qualify. \nWindows into bicycle parking areas are allowed to qualify for up to 25 percent of the ground \nfloor windows coverage requirement. Except for the windows of residential units and \nclerestory windows located above doors or other windows, the bottom of qualifying windows \nmust be no more than 4 feet above the adjacent exterior grade.  Chapter 33.150 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCampus Institutional Zones 3/1/25 \n150-18 \nD. Ground floor window and frontage standards for dwelling units. The ground floor wall area of \nstreet-facing facades of dwelling units that are 20 feet or closer to a street lot line must meet at \nleast one of the following standards: \n1. Flexible ground floor design. The ground floor window standard of Subparagraph B.1.a. \nmust be met, and the ground level of the building must be designed and constructed as \nfollows: \na. The distance from the finished floor to the bottom of the ceiling structure above \nmust be at least 12 feet. The bottom of the structure above includes supporting \nbeams; \nb. The area meeting this standard must be at least 25 feet deep, measured from the \nstreet-facing facade; and \nc. Each unit must include a front entrance that is located at the level of the finished \ngrade and can be accessed without steps. \n2. Front setback.  \na.

Where a proposal is eligible to use this chapter, the applicant may choose to go \nthrough the discretionary review process set out in Chapter 33.846, Historic Resource Reviews, or to \nmeet the objective standards of this chapter. If the applicant chooses to meet the objective \nstandards of this chapter, no discretionary review process is required.  \nThe purpose of these standards is to:  \nA. Ensure that new development enhances the character and livability of Portland’s historic \nneighborhoods; \nB. Ensure that increased density in established neighborhoods makes a positive contribution \nto the area's character; \nC. Ensure the historic integrity of conservation landmarks and the compatibility of new \ndevelopment in conservation districts; \nD. Enhance the character and environment for pedestrians in historic areas; \nE. Offer developers the opportunity to comply with specific objective standards as a more \ntimely, cost effective, and more certain alternative to the historic resource review process.   Chapter 33.218 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCommunity Design Standards 8/1/21 \n \n218-2 \n33.218.015 Procedure \nA. Generally. This chapter provides an alternative to the historic resource review process for \nsome proposals. Where a proposal is eligible to use this chapter, the applicant may choose \nto go through either the discretionary review process set out in Chapter 33.846, Historic \nResource Reviews, or to meet the objective standards of this chapter. If the proposal meets \nthe standards of this chapter, no historic resource review is required. The standards \ndetermining which proposals are eligible to use this chapter are in Chapter 33.445, Historic \nResource Overlay Zone.  \n The standards of this chapter do not apply to proposals reviewed through the discretionary \ndesign review processes set out in Chapter 33.846, Historic Resource Reviews. Where a \nproposal is for an alteration or addition to existing development, the standards of this \nchapter apply only to the portion being altered  \nor added. \nB. Adjustments. Adjustments to these standards are prohibited. \nC. Permit application requirements. The following information must be submitted as part of \nan application for a building or development permit: \n1.

Of special concern are noise from idling cars and voice \namplification equipment, lighting, and queued traffic interfering with on-site and off-site traffic and \npedestrian flow. The specific purposes of this chapter are to: \n• Reduce noise, lighting, and visual impacts on abutting uses, particularly residential uses; \n• Promote safer and more efficient on-site vehicular and pedestrian circulation; \n• Reduce conflicts between queued vehicles and traffic on adjacent streets. \n33.224.020 When These Regulations Apply \nA. Uses. The regulations of this chapter apply to all uses that have drive-through facilities. \nB. Site development.  \n1. Except as specified in Paragraph B.2, below, the regulations of this chapter apply only \nto the portions of the site development that comprise the drive-through facility. The \nregulations apply to new developments, the addition of drive-through facilities to \nexisting developments, and the relocation of an existing drive-through facility. Drive-\nthrough facilities are not a right; the size of the site or the size and location of existing \nstructures may make it impossible to meet the regulations of this chapter. Chapter \n33.266 contains additional requirements regarding vehicle areas. \n2. The site development standards of Sections 33.224.030 through 33.224.050 do not \napply to drive-through facilities that do not involve any interactive service or \ncommunication with the customer. \nC. Parts of a drive-through facility. A drive-through facility is composed of two parts – the \nstacking lanes and the service area. The stacking lanes are the space occupied by vehicles \nqueueing for the service to be provided. The service area is where the service occurs. In \nuses with service windows, the service area starts at the service window. In uses where the \nservice occurs indoors, the service area is the area within the building where the service \noccurs. For other development, such as gas pumps, air compressors, vacuum cleaning \nstations, the service area is the area where the vehicles are parked during the service. \n33.224.030 Setbacks and Landscaping \nAll drive-through facilities must provide the setbacks and landscaping stated below.  Chapter 33.224 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nDrive-Through Facilities 3/1/25 \n \n224-2 \nA. Abutting an R, IR, or CI1 zone. Service areas and stacking lanes must be set back 5 feet \nfrom all lot lines that abut an R, IR, or CI1 zone. The 5 foot setback must be landscaped to \nat least the  \nL3 standard. \nB. Abutting a C, E, I, or CI2 zone. Service areas and stacking lanes must be set back 5 feet \nfrom all lot lines that abut an C, E, I, or CI2 zone. The 5 foot setback must be landscaped to \nat least the L2 standard. \nC. Abutting a street. Where allowed by Chapter 33.266, Parking and Loading, service areas \nand stacking lanes must be setback 5 feet from all street lot lines.

Minor or emergency \nrepairs and routine maintenance are allowed in all zones. \n33.243.040 Standards \nA. Safety standards. \n1. Federal Standards. Public HLFs must meet the most stringent safety standards since \nthey are used by pilots of varying familiarity with the flight path locations, typical wind \neffects, and facility layout. To meet this highest level of safety, such facilities must \nmeet all recommended standards of the FAA Heliport Design Guide, AC150/5390. The \nreview body must include any conditions of approval recommended by the FAA as a \ncondition of approval. \n2. State Standards. Private HLFs must also meet safety standards as required by the \nAeronautics Division of the State of Oregon. \n3. Fire Safety Standards. All HLFs must meet fire suppression and safety standards of the \nFire Marshal. \nB. Development standards. \n1. Minimum site area. The site area and physical facilities must be able to accommodate \naircraft parking and landing pads, motor vehicle and emergency equipment access and \nparking, buffering and screening, and sufficient helicopter parking spaces to allow the \nlanding of approaching aircraft without delay. \n2. Setbacks and minimum distances from residential zones. The review body may impose \nsetbacks and minimum distances from residential zones for HLFs as follows: \na. A distance of 200 feet will be used as a guideline for setbacks for all HLFs \ndeveloped within residential zones. The distance in commercial and industrial \nzones is 50 feet, except that for sites abutting residentially zoned land the \ndistance is the 200 feet. All setbacks will be measured from the edge of the \nlanding pad. \nb. These distances may be increased or decreased by the review body upon \nconsideration of such factors as the number of flights, hours of operation, types  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.243 \n6/30/23 Helicopter Landing Facilities \n \n243-3 \nof aircraft, number of aircraft, types of existing land uses in the area, topography, \nproximity to natural aircraft corridors, and type and nature of the proposed noise \nmitigation plan. \nc. A 20 foot deep area landscaped to at least the L4 standard must be provided \naround the HLF. The landscape standards are stated in 33.248, Landscaping and \nScreening. Trees must be located so as to not encroach into a 8 (horizontal) to 1 \n(vertical) flight path from the landing pad in all directions. \n3. Off-street parking. For HLFs that are primary uses, the maximum amount of off-street \nparking allowed will be determined during the conditional use review, based on the \nnumber of employees, types and number of flights, and types of facilities proposed.  \n4. Street trees. Street trees may be required for all ground level facilities. Trees must be \nlocated so as to not encroach into a 8 (horizontal) to 1 (vertical) flight path from the \nlanding path in all directions. \n5. Surfacing.

The regulations address materials, placement, layout, preparation of the \nlandscape or mitigation area, and timing of installation. Specific requirements for mitigation \nplantings are in 33.248.090. \nThe Portland Tree and Landscaping Manual contains additional information about ways to meet the \nregulations of this chapter. The Portland Plant List includes information about native plants, non-\nnative, non-nuisance plants, and nuisance plants.  \n33.248.020 Landscaping and Screening Standards \nSubsections A. through H. state the different levels of landscaping and screening standards to be \napplied throughout the City. The locations where the landscaping or screening is required and the \ndepth of the landscaping or screening are stated in various places throughout the Code. All \nlandscaping and screening required by this Title must comply with all of the provisions of this \nchapter, unless specifically superseded. The landscaping standards are minimums; additional  Chapter 33.248 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nLandscaping and Screening 8/10/20 \n \n248-2 \nvegetation or screening can be proposed, provided all minimum fence or vegetation height and \nscreening requirements are met. Crime prevention and safety should be remembered when \nexceeding the landscaping standards (height and amount of vegetation may be an issue). Trees \npreserved or planted to meet the requirements of Chapter 11.50, Trees in Development Situations \ncount toward the landscaping and screening standards of this Title. \nA. L1, general landscaping. \n1. Intent. The L1 standard is a landscape treatment for open areas. It is intended to be \napplied in situations where distance is used as the principal means of separating uses \nor development, and landscaping is required to enhance the area in-between. While \nprimarily consisting of ground cover plants, it also includes a mixture of trees, high \nshrubs, and low shrubs. \n2. Required materials. The L1 standard has two different requirements for trees and \nshrubs. Ground cover plants must fully cover the remainder of the landscaped area. \na. Where the area to be landscaped is less than 30 feet deep, the standard is one \nlarge tree per 30 linear feet, one medium tree per 22 linear feet, or one small \ntree per 15 linear feet. Trees of different sizes may be combined to meet the \nstandard. Trees may be grouped. \nb. Where the area is 30 feet deep or greater, the requirement is either two high \nshrubs or three low shrubs per 400 square feet of landscaped area in addition to \nthe trees required in 2.a, above. The shrubs and trees may be grouped. \nB. L2, low screen. \n1. Intent. The L2 standard is a landscape treatment which uses a combination of distance \nand low level screening to separate uses or development. The standard is applied \nwhere a low level of screening is adequate to soften the impact of the use or \ndevelopment, or where visibility between areas is more important than a total visual \nscreen. It is usually applied along street lot lines. \n2. Required materials. The L2 standard requires enough low shrubs to form a continuous \nscreen 3 feet high. The shrubs must be evergreen. In addition, one large tree is \nrequired per 30 linear feet of landscaped area, one medium tree per 22 linear feet of \nlandscaped area, or one small tree per 15 linear feet of landscaped area. Trees of \ndifferent sizes may be combined to meet the standard. Ground cover plants must fully \ncover the remainder of the landscaped area. A 3-foot-high masonry wall or a berm \nmay be substituted for the shrubs, but the trees and ground cover plants are still \nrequired. When applied along street lot lines, any required or nonrequired screen, \nwall, or fence is to be placed along the interior side of the landscaped area. \nC. L3, high screen. \n1. Intent. The L3 standard is a landscape treatment which uses screening to provide the \nphysical and visual separation between uses or development. It is used in those \ninstances where visual separation is required. \n2. Required materials. The L3 standard requires enough high shrubs to form a screen 6 \nfeet high. The shrubs must be evergreen. In addition, one large tree is required per 30  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.248 \n8/10/20 Landscaping and Screening \n \n248-3 \nlinear feet of landscaped area, one medium tree per 22 linear feet of landscaped area, \nor one small tree per 15 linear feet of landscaped area. Trees of different sizes may be \ncombined to meet the standard. Ground cover plants must fully cover the remainder \nof the landscaped area. A 6-foot-high masonry wall may be substituted for the shrubs, \nbut the trees and ground cover plants are still required. When applied along street lot \nlines, any required or nonrequired screen, wall, or fence is to be placed along the \ninterior side of the landscaped area. \nD. L4, high wall. \n1. Intent. The L4 standard is intended to be used in special instances where extensive \nscreening of both visual and noise impacts is needed to protect abutting sensitive uses \nin areas and where there is little space for separation. \n2. Required materials. The L4 standard requires a 6 foot high masonry wall along the \ninterior side of the landscaped area. One large tree is required per 30 linear feet of \nwall, one medium tree per 22 linear feet of wall, or one small tree per 15 linear feet of \nwall. Trees of different sizes may be combined to meet the standard. In addition, four \nhigh shrubs are required per 30 linear feet of wall. Ground cover plants must fully \ncover the remainder of the landscaped area. \nE. L5, high berm. \n1. Intent. The L5 standard is intended to be used in special instances where extensive \nscreening of both visual and noise impacts is needed to protect abutting sensitive \nuses, and where it is desirable and practical to separate a use by distance as well as \nsight-obscuring materials. \n2. Required materials. The L5 standard requires a berm between 4 and 6 feet high. If the \nberm is less than 6 feet high, low shrubs that meet the L2 standard must be planted \non top of the berm to assure that the overall screen height is 6 feet. In addition, one \nlarge tree is required per 30 linear feet of berm, one medium tree per 22 linear feet of \nberm, or one small tree per 15 linear feet of berm. Trees of different sizes may be \ncombined to meet the standard. Ground cover plants must fully cover the remainder \nof the landscaped area. The L5 standard may be used to substitute for required L2 or \nL3 landscaping. \nF. F1, partially sight-obscuring fence.  \n1. Intent. The F1 fence standard provides a tall, but not totally blocked visual separation. \nThe standard is applied where a low level of screening is adequate to soften the \nimpact of the use or development, or where visibility between areas is more \nimportant than a total visual screen. It is applied in instances where landscaping is not \nnecessary and where nonresidential uses are involved. \n2. Required materials. Fences must be 6 feet high and at least 50 percent sight-\nobscuring. Fences may be made of wood, metal, bricks, masonry or other permanent \nmaterials. See Figure 248-1. \n \nG. F2, fully sight-obscuring fence.   Chapter 33.248 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nLandscaping and Screening 8/10/20 \n \n248-4 \n1. Intent. The F2 fence standard provides a tall and complete visual separation, and is \nintended to be used in special instances where complete screening is needed to \nprotect abutting uses, and landscaping is not practical. It is usually applied in \nnonresidential situations. \n2. Required materials. Fences must be 6 feet high and 100 percent sight-obscuring. \nFences may be made of wood, metal, bricks, masonry or other permanent materials. \nSee Figure 248-2. \nFigure 248-1     Figure 248-2 \nF1 – Partially Sight-Obscuring   F2 – Totally Sight-Obscuring \n \nH. P1, parking lot interior landscaping. \n1. Intent. The P1 standard is a landscape treatment which uses a combination of trees, \nshrubs, and ground cover to provide shade, stormwater management, aesthetic \nbenefits, and screening to soften the impacts of large expanses of pavement and \nvehicle movement. It is applied to landscaped areas within parking lots and associated \nvehicle areas. \n2. Required materials. \na. Trees. The P1 standard requires one large tree per 4 parking spaces, one medium \ntree per 3 parking spaces, or one small tree per 2 parking spaces. At least 20 \npercent of trees must be evergreen. Trees of different sizes may be combined to \nmeet the standard. \nb. Shrubs. The P1 standard requires 1.5 shrubs per space. For spaces where the \nfront two feet of parking spaces have been landscaped instead of paved, the P1 \nstandard requires one shrub per space. Shrubs may be evergreen or deciduous. \nc. Ground cover plants. The P1 standard requires that the remainder of the area \nmust be planted in ground cover plants. The plants must be spaced to cover the \narea within 3 years. Mulch does not count as ground cover. \n \n \n33.248.030 Plant Materials \nA. Ground cover.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.248 \n8/10/20 Landscaping and Screening \n \n248-5 \n1. Ground cover required. All of the landscaped area that is not planted with trees and \nshrubs must be planted in ground cover plants, which may include grasses. Mulch (as \na ground cover) must be confined to areas underneath plants and is not a substitute \nfor ground cover plants. \n2. Size and spacing. Ground cover plants other than grasses must be at least the four-\ninch pot size. Area planted in ground cover plants other than grass seed or sod must \nbe planted in triangular spacing (see Figure 248-3) at distances appropriate for the \nplant species. Ground cover plants must be planted at a density that will cover the \nentire area within three years. \n To use a ground cover plant not listed in the Portland Tree and Landscaping Manual, \nthe applicant must provide Portland Permitting & Development with an objective \nsource of information about the plant’s requirements for spacing. Applicants are \nencouraged to provide information about the plant’s watering needs, sun or shade \npreference, and climate zone hardiness. This information can come from published \nsources, Internet sources, or nursery information, for example, cut sheets. \nFigure 248-3 \nExample of Ground Cover Planting on Twelve-Inch Centers \n \nB. Shrubs. All shrubs must be of sufficient size and number to meet the required standards \nwithin 3 years of planting. Shrubs must be at least the one-gallon container size at planting. \nC. Trees.  \n1. Planting size. Trees may be broadleaf or conifers and must meet the following: \na. Broadleaf trees at the time of planting must be fully branched and must be a \nminimum of 1.5 caliper inches.  \nb. Conifer trees at the time of planting must be fully branched and a minimum of 5 \nfeet in height.  \nc. Specific planting size requirements related to the mitigation, remediation, or \nrestoration of landscaped areas in overlay zones and plan districts supersede the \nminimums of this paragraph. These minimum requirements do not apply to trees \napproved through an Environmental Review, or Pleasant Valley Resource Review \nto be used for mitigation, remediation, or restoration.  Chapter 33.248 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nLandscaping and Screening 8/10/20 \n \n248-6 \n2. Size category. \na. Trees are categorized as small, medium, or large using the formulas in C.2.c. The \nPortland Tree and Landscaping Manual’s suggested plant lists include the size \ncategories recognized by PP&D for many trees. \nb. To determine the size category of a tree not listed in the Portland Tree and \nLandscaping Manual, the applicant must provide PP&D with an objective source \nof information about the tree’s mature height, crown spread, and growth rate. \nThis information can come from published sources, Internet sources, or nursery \ninformation such as cut sheets. PP&D will assign the tree to one of the size \ncategories using the formulas in C.2.c, and will periodically update the suggested \ntree list to include newly categorized trees. \nc. The size of a tree is calculated according to the following formulas, which \nincorporate the estimated height and crown spread of a mature specimen and on \nthe species’ growth rate: \n(1) Small trees have a canopy factor of less than 40, medium trees have a \ncanopy factor from 40 to 90, and large trees have a canopy factor greater \nthan 90; \n(2) Mature height of tree x Mature canopy spread x Growth rate factor x 0.01 = \nCanopy factor; \n(3) The growth rate factor is 3 for fast-growing trees, 2 for medium-growing \ntrees, and 1 for slow-growing trees. \n3. Existing trees may be used to meet the standards of this chapter, as described in \nParagraph D.1. Existing trees must be protected as specified in Title 11, Trees.  See \nChapter 11.60, Technical Specifications. \nD. Plant material choices and preparation. \n1. Existing vegetation. Existing vegetation except those plants listed on the Nuisance \nPlants List may be used to meet the standards, if protected and maintained during the \nconstruction phase of the development. Existing trees are counted as follows: \na. Each tree at least 1.5 inches and less than 6 inches in diameter counts as one \nsmall tree; \nb. Each tree 6 or more inches in diameter counts as 1 medium tree for each full 6 \ninch increment.  For example, a 19-inch tree would count as three medium trees, \nwhile an 11-inch tree would count as one medium tree; \n2. Selection of materials. Landscape materials should be selected and sited to produce a \nhardy and drought-resistant landscape area. Selection should include consideration of \nsoil type and depth, the amount of maintenance required, spacing, exposure to sun \nand wind, the slope and contours of the site, and compatibility with existing native \nvegetation preserved on the site. Arborescent shrubs from the Portland Plant List may \nnot be used to meet the tree requirement. \n3. Plant diversity.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.248 \n8/10/20 Landscaping and Screening \n \n248-7 \na. Trees.

Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.248 \n8/10/20 Landscaping and Screening \n \n248-9 \nB. Plant Materials. The Mitigation Plan must specify that plant materials are to be used for \nrestoration purposes. Generally, this means that standard nursery practices for growing \nlandscape plants, such as use of pesticides, fungicides or fertilizers, and the staking of trees \nmust not be employed. \nC. Nuisance Plants. Plants listed on the Nuisance Plants List are prohibited from being planted \nin mitigation areas, and may not be counted as existing vegetation.  \nD. Landscaped Area Preparation. All new required mitigation areas must be cleared or \ngroundcovers and shrubs listed on the Nuisance Plants List. If the site is within the \nEnvironmental Overlay Zone, the Pleasant Valley Natural Resources Overlay Zone, the River \nNatural Overlay Zone, the River Water Quality Overlay Zone, or the River Environmental \nOverlay Zone, then trees listed on the Nuisance Plants List must be removed from the \nrequired \n mitigation area. \nE. Installation. Plant materials must be supported only when necessary due to extreme winds \nat the planting site. Where support is necessary, stakes, guy wires or other measures must \nbe removed as soon as the plant can support itself. \nF. Irrigation. The intent of this standard is to ensure that plants will survive the critical \nestablishment period when they are most vulnerable due to lack of watering. New \nplantings must be manually watered regularly during the first growing season. During later \nseasons, watering must be done as needed to ensure survival of the plants. \nG. Monitoring and Reporting. Monitoring of landscape areas is the ongoing responsibility of \nthe property owner. Plants that die must be replaced in kind. Written proof that all \nspecifications of this section have been met must be provided one year after the planting is \ncompleted. The property owner must provide this documentation to PP&D.

In \naddition, gates with fencing at least 6 feet high must be provided across all entrances. The \nproperty owner must maintain the fencing and gates in good repair. \n33.254.090 Activities in Required Setbacks \nExtraction, movement, or stockpiling of mineral and aggregate resources or the disposal or storage \nof waste products within a required setback is prohibited. The tops and toes of cut and fill slopes \nmust remain outside the required setback. Structures, exterior storage, and parking areas for trucks \nor equipment are not allowed within the required setbacks. Required setbacks includes all setbacks \napproved by the State for Mining uses. \n33.254.100 Underground Utilities \nAll underground lines and conduits on a mining or landfill site and within 50 feet of the site must be \nprotected from damage from the use. This includes storm and sanitary sewers, and water, gas, and \nelectric lines. \n \n(Amended by: Ord. No. 174263, effective 4/15/00; Ord. No. 177028, effective 12/14/02; Ord.

As part of the change, existing uses, density, or development might no \nlonger be allowed. The intent of the change is not to force all noncomplying situations to be \nimmediately brought into conformance. Instead, the intent is to guide future uses and development \nin a new direction consistent with City policy, and, eventually, bring them into conformance.  \nThis chapter provides methods to determine whether situations have legal nonconforming status. \nThis is based on whether they were allowed when established, and if they have been maintained \nover time. This chapter also provides a method to review and limit nonconforming situations when \nchanges to those situations are proposed. The intent is to protect the character of the area by \nreducing the negative impacts from nonconforming situations. At the same time, the regulations \nassure that the uses and development may continue and that the zoning regulations will not cause \nunnecessary burdens. \nNonconforming situations that have a lesser impact on the immediate area have fewer restrictions \nthan those with greater impacts. Nonconforming uses in residential zones are treated more strictly \nthan those in commercial/mixed use, employment, industrial, or campus institutional zones to \nprotect the livability and character of residential neighborhoods. In contrast, nonconforming \nresidential developments in residential zones are treated more liberally because they do not \nrepresent a major disruption to the neighborhood and they provide needed housing opportunities in \nthe City. \n33.258.030 Types of Nonconforming Situations \nA specific site may be nonconforming because it contains either a nonconforming use, an allowed \nresidential use that exceeds the allowed density, a nonconforming development, or a combination \nof these. Nonconforming uses, nonconforming residential densities, and nonconforming \ndevelopment are defined in Chapter 33.910, Definitions.  Chapter 33.258 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nNonconforming Situations 10/1/24 \n \n258-2 \n \n33.258.035 Where These Regulations Apply  \nThe nonconforming situation regulations apply only to those nonconforming situations which were \nallowed when established or which were approved through a land use review. Additionally, they \nmust have been maintained over time. These situations have legal nonconforming status. \nNonconforming situations which were not allowed when established or have not been maintained \nover time have no legal right to continue and must be removed.  \n33.258.037 Documenting Conforming Development \nSites with nonconforming development must come into compliance with certain development \nstandards in some situations, as required by Paragraph 33.258.070.D.2. To streamline the permitting \nprocess, applicants may request that sites that are in compliance be certified by PP&D as in \ncompliance with the development standards listed in Paragraph 33.258.070.D.2. \n33.258.038 Documenting A Nonconforming Situation  \nThe applicant must provide evidence to show that the situation was allowed when established and \nwas maintained over time. If the applicant provides standard evidence from the list below, the \nDirector of PP&D will determine if the evidence is satisfactory. The Director of PP&D will also \ndetermine, based on the evidence, what the current legal use is, using the definitions in Chapter \n33.910 and the use categories in Chapter 33.920. If the applicant provides evidence other than the \nstandard evidence listed below, a Determination of Legal Nonconforming Status is required.  \n(See 33.258.075.) \nA. Situation allowed when established. Standard evidence that the situation was allowed \nwhen established is: \n1. Building, land use, or development permits; or \n2. Zoning codes or maps; \nB. Situation maintained over time. Standard evidence that the use has been maintained over \ntime is: \n1. Utility bills; \n2. Income tax records; \n3. Business licenses; \n4. Listings in telephone, business, or Polk directories; \n5. Advertisements in dated publications; \n6. Building, land use, or development permits; \n7. Insurance policies; \n8. Leases; \n9. Dated aerial photos; \n10. Insurance maps that identify use or development, such as the Sanborn Maps; or \n11. Land use and development inventories prepared by a government agency.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.258 \n3/1/25 Nonconforming Situations \n \n258-3 \n33.258.040 Regulations that Apply to All Nonconforming Situations \nA. Ownership. The status of a nonconforming situation is not affected by changes  \nin ownership. \nB. Change to a conforming situation. A nonconforming situation may be changed to a \nconforming situation by right. Once a conforming situation occupies the site, the \nnonconforming rights are lost and a nonconforming situation may not be re-established. \nC. Change to conditional use. A nonconforming use may change to a conditional use if \napproved through a conditional use review. Some previously nonconforming uses receive \nautomatic conditional use status, as described in 33.815.030. Once a conditional use \noccupies the site, the nonconforming rights are lost and a nonconforming use may not be \nre-established.  \nD. Maintenance. Normal maintenance and repair of nonconforming situations is allowed.  \n33.258.050 Nonconforming Uses  \nA. Continued operation. Nonconforming uses may continue to operate. Changes in \noperations, such as changes in ownership, hours of operation and the addition or \nsubtraction of accessory uses, are allowed. However, nonconforming uses in residential \nzones may not extend their hours of operation into the period of 11 pm to 6 am.  \nB. Change of use in the same use category. A change to a different use in the same use \ncategory, such as a change from one type of Community Services use to another type of \nCommunity Services use, is allowed by right. For changes of use within the same use \ncategory which do not meet the off-site impact standards, the change may be allowed \nthrough a nonconforming situation review.   \nC. Change of use in a different category. A change to a use in a different use category which \nis prohibited by the base zone may be allowed through a nonconforming situation review. \nIn R zones, a change from a nonconforming nonresidential use to an allowed residential use \nthat exceeds the allowed density may be allowed through a nonconforming situation \nreview. An example of this is conversion of a storefront in an R7 zone (nonconforming use) \nto a triplex (allowed use, nonconforming residential density).  \nD. Expansions. Nonconforming uses may expand under certain circumstances. Exterior \nimprovements may expand by increasing the amount of land used. Changing the exterior \nuse, for example from parking to storage, is an expansion of exterior storage. Adding \nparking spaces to an existing lot is also an expansion. However, increasing the amount of \ngoods stored on an existing exterior storage area is a change in operations, not an \nexpansion. Examples of expansion of gross building area include expanding a \nnonconforming use into a newly constructed building or addition on the site, and \nexpanding the amount of gross building area occupied by a nonconforming use within an \nexisting building. \n Expansion of nonconforming uses and development is generally limited to the area \nbounded by the property lines of the use as they existed two years before the use became \nnonconforming. The property lines are the lines nearest to the land area occupied by the \nnonconforming use and development and its accessory uses and development, moving in \nan outward direction. Property lines bound individual lots, parcels, and tax lots; a site or  Chapter 33.258 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nNonconforming Situations 3/1/25 \n \n258-4 \n \nownership may have property lines within it. See Figures 258-1 and 258-2. The applicant \nmust provide evidence to show the location of property lines as they existed two years \nbefore the use became nonconforming.  \n1. OS, R, and IR zones. The standards stated below apply to all nonconforming uses in OS \nand R zones. \na. Expansions of gross building area or exterior improvements, when proposed \nwithin the property lines as they existed two years before the use became \nnonconforming, may be approved through a nonconforming situation review. \nThe development standards of the base zone, overlay zone, and plan district \nmust be met. \nb. Expansion of gross building area or exterior improvements beyond the property \nlines as they existed two years before the use became nonconforming,  \nis prohibited. \nFigure 258-1 \nArea of Possible Expansion - OS and R Zones  \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.258 \n10/1/24 Nonconforming Situations \n \n258-5 \nFigure 258-2 \nArea of Possible Expansion - C, E, and I Zones  \n \n2. C, E, I, and CI zones. The standards stated below apply to all nonconforming uses in C, \nE, I, and CI zones. \na. Except as allowed by Subparagraph C.2.b, below, expansions of gross building \narea or exterior improvements, when proposed within the property lines as they \nexisted two years before the use became nonconforming, may be approved \nthrough a nonconforming situation review. The development standards of the \nbase zone, overlay zone, and plan district must be met for the expansion.  \nb. In EG1, EG2, and I zones, expansions of gross building area for nonconforming \nHousehold Living uses, when proposed within the property lines as they existed \ntwo years before the use became nonconforming, are allowed if all of the \nfollowing are met: \n(1) The expansion will not increase the gross building area by more than 500 \nsquare feet over the floor area that existed when the use became \nnonconforming. Expansions that increase the gross building area by more \nthan 500 square feet over the gross building area that existed when the use \nbecame nonconforming may be requested through a nonconforming \nsituation review; \n(2) The expansion must comply with development standards of the base zone, \noverlay zone, and plan district; and \n(3) The addition of new dwelling units is prohibited.  Chapter 33.258 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nNonconforming Situations 10/1/24 \n \n258-6 \n \nc. In E and I zones, expansions of exterior improvements for nonconforming \nHousehold Living uses are allowed if they comply with the development \nstandards of the base zone, overlay zone, and plan district. \nd. Expansion of gross building area or exterior improvements, when proposed \nbeyond the property lines as they existed two years before the use became \nnonconforming, is prohibited, except in the following situation: \n(1) The property proposed for expansion is abutting at least one of the property \nlines of the nonconforming use as they existed two years before the use \nbecame nonconforming; and  \n(2) The property proposed for expansion was in the same ownership as the \nproperty holding the nonconforming use when it became  \nnonconforming; and \n(3) The zoning regulations on the property proposed for expansion would have \nallowed the use at the time the existing situation became  \nnonconforming; and  \n(4) The expansion is approved through a nonconforming situation review.  \nE. Loss of nonconforming use status. \n1. Discontinuance. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for 3 continuous years, the \nnonconforming use rights are lost. If a nonconforming use ceases operations, even if \nthe structure or materials related to the use remain, the use has been discontinued. If \na nonconforming use changes to another use without obtaining all building, land use, \nand development permits that would have been required at the time of the change, \nthe legal nonconforming use has been discontinued. A nonconforming use that has \nbeen discontinued for more than 3 continuous years may request re-establishment \nthrough a nonconforming situation review. Re-establishment of a nonconforming use \nthat has been discontinued for 5 or more continuous years is prohibited.  \n2. Accidental destruction. When a structure containing a nonconforming use is damaged \nby fire or other causes beyond the control of the owner, the re-establishment of the \nnonconforming use is prohibited if the repair cost of the structure is more than 75 \npercent of its assessed value. \n3. Intentional destruction. When a structure containing a nonconforming use is \nintentionally damaged by fire or other causes within the control of the owner, the re-\nestablishment of the nonconforming use is prohibited. \n33.258.060 Nonconforming Residential Densities  \nA. Changes to dwellings.  \n1. Generally. Existing dwelling units may continue, may be removed or enlarged, and \namenities may be added to the site.  \na. Sites that exceed maximum residential density standard. On sites that exceed the \nmaximum residential density standards, there may not be a net increase in the \nnumber of dwelling units and the building may not move further out of  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.258 \n10/1/24 Nonconforming Situations \n \n258-7 \ncompliance with the base zone development standards, except as allowed in \nParagraph A.2, below. \nb. Sites where the minimum residential density standard is not met. The following \napply to sites where the minimum residential density standard is not met: \n(1) In multi-dwelling zones, there may not be a net decrease in the number of \ndwelling units, and the site may not move further out of compliance with \nbase zone development standards. Generally, when dwelling units are being \nadded to a site that is nonconforming in minimum density, the site must be \nbrought into conformance with the minimum density requirement. \nHowever, units may be added to the site without coming all the way into \nconformance with the minimum residential density standard in the \nfollowing situations: \n• An accessory dwelling unit is being added to an existing house, attached \nhouse, duplex, or manufactured home; \n• Dwelling units are being added within an existing structure and the \nfootprint of the existing structure is not being enlarged;  \n• Dwelling units are being added to a site in the RMP zone; \n• The site is within the combined flood hazard area or potential landslide \nhazard area.  \n(2) In all other zones, changes may be made that bring the site closer into \nconformance with the minimum residential density standard. There may not \nbe a net decrease in the number of dwelling units, and the building may not \nmove further out of compliance with the base zone development standards. \n2. In multi-dwelling zones. In multi-dwelling zones, sites with residential structures may \nmove out of compliance or further out of compliance with the maximum density \nstandards of Table 120-3 if all of the following are met: \na. The residential structure was constructed before December 31, 1980; and \nb. The site is moving out of compliance or further out of compliance with the \nmaximum density standards due to a separation of ownership as allowed by \nSubsection 33.120.205.C. \nB. Discontinuance and damage. \n1. Building unoccupied but standing. Nonconforming residential density rights continue \neven when a building has been unoccupied for any length of time. \n2. Accidental damage or destruction. \na. More than one dwelling unit. When there is more than one dwelling unit on a \nsite, and when the site is nonconforming for residential density, the following \napplies if a structure containing dwelling units is damaged or destroyed by fire or \nother causes beyond the control of the owner:  \n(1) If the structure is rebuilt within 5 years, nonconforming residential density \nrights are maintained;   Chapter 33.258 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nNonconforming Situations 10/1/24 \n \n258-8 \n \n(2) If the structure is not rebuilt within 5 years, the nonconforming residential \ndensity rights are lost, and the site is considered vacant; \n(3) If the repair cost is more than 75 percent of the assessed value of the \nstructure, the new structure must comply with one of the following, \nwhichever is less restrictive:  \n• The development standards (except for density) that would apply to \nnew development on the site; or  \n• The development standards (except for density) that would apply to \nnew development in the RM1 zone. \nb. One dwelling unit. When there is only one dwelling unit on a site, and when the \nsite is nonconforming for residential density, the following applies if the structure \ncontaining the dwelling unit is damaged or destroyed by fire or other causes \nbeyond the control of the owner:  \n(1) If the repair cost is 75 percent or less of the assessed value of the structure, \nnonconforming residential density rights are maintained and the structure \nmay be rebuilt;  \n(2) If the repair cost is more than 75 percent of the assessed value of the \nstructure, the structure may be rebuilt within 5 years if it complies with the \ndevelopment standards (except for density) that would apply to new \ndevelopment on the site;  \n(3) If the repair cost is more than 75 percent of the assessed value of the \nstructure, and the structure is not rebuilt within 5 years, the nonconforming \nresidential density rights are lost, and the site is considered vacant. \n3. Intentional damage, destruction or demolition. When a structure that is non-\nconforming for residential density is intentionally damaged, destroyed or \ndemolished by fire or other causes within the control of the owner, the \nnonconforming residential density rights are lost, and the new development \nmust meet all development standards for the site. \n33.258.065 Nonconforming Lots, Lots of Record, and Lot Remnants in Single-Dwelling Zones \nA. Changes to Dwellings. Existing dwelling units on nonconforming lots, lots of record, or lot \nremnants may continue, may be removed or enlarged, and amenities may be added to the \nsite, but the building may not move further out of compliance with the base zone \ndevelopment standards. \nB. Damage. \n1. When a nonconforming lot, lot of record, or lot remnant contains a dwelling unit that \nis damaged or destroyed by fire or by other causes beyond the control of the owner, \nthe structure may be rebuilt as specified in 33.258.070.E. \n2. When a nonconforming lot, lot of record, or lot remnant contains a dwelling unit that \nis intentionally damaged or demolished, the structure may be rebuilt if it complies \nwith the development standards that would apply to new development on the site.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.258 \n3/1/25 Nonconforming Situations \n \n258-9 \n33.258.070 Nonconforming Development \nA. Purpose. This section is primarily aimed at upgrading nonconforming development \nelements that affect the appearance and impacts of a site. It is not intended to require \nextensive changes that would be extremely impractical such as moving or  \nlowering buildings. \nB. Continued operation. Nonconforming developments may continue unless specifically \nlimited by Subsection D. below or other regulations in this Title.  \nC. Changes.  \n1. Changes to the site that do not alter the nonconforming development are allowed. \n2. Changes to the nonconforming development are allowed as follows: \na. Changes that bring the nonconforming development closer to conformance are \nallowed; and \nb. Changes to the nonconforming development that do not move it closer to \nconformance are subject to the adjustment process unless prohibited.  \nD. Development that must be brought into conformance. The regulations of this subsection \nare divided into two types of situations, depending upon whether the use is also \nnonconforming or not. These regulations apply except where superseded by more specific \nregulations in the code.  \n1. Nonconforming development with a new nonconforming use or new non-conforming \nresidential density. When there is a change to a different non-conforming use, or a \nchange from a nonconforming nonresidential use to a non-conforming residential \ndensity, the following nonconforming development must be brought into compliance \nwith the development standards that apply to the site (base, overlay, plan district, \nspecial use, tree density standards in Title 11): \na. Landscaping and trees required for the following areas: \n• Exterior display, storage, and work activity areas; \n• Setbacks for surface parking and exterior development areas; \n• Interior parking lot landscaping; \n• Existing building setbacks; \n• Minimum landscaped areas (where land is not used for structures, parking, or \nexterior improvements); and \n• On-site tree density standards of Subsection 11.50.050.C. \nb. Pedestrian circulation systems, as set out in the pedestrian standards that apply \nto the site; \nc. Bicycle parking by upgrading existing bicycle parking and providing additional \nspaces in order to comply with 33.266.200 and 33.266.210; \nd. Screening; and \ne. Paving of surface parking and exterior storage and display areas.  Chapter 33.258 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nNonconforming Situations 3/1/25 \n \n258-10 \n \n2. Nonconforming development with an existing nonconforming use, allowed use, \nlimited use, or conditional use. Nonconforming development associated with an \nexisting nonconforming use, an allowed use, a limited use, or a conditional use, must \nmeet the requirements stated below. When alterations are made that are over the \nthreshold of Subparagraph D.2.a., the site must be brought into conformance with the \ndevelopment standards listed in Subparagraph D.2.b. The value of the alterations is \nbased on the entire project, not individual building permits. Sites with residential uses \nare exempt from the requirements until January 1, 2029. \na. Thresholds triggering compliance. The standards of Subparagraph D.2.b., below, \nmust be met when the value of the proposed alterations on the site, as \ndetermined by PP&D, is more than $356,300. The following alterations and \nimprovements do not count toward the threshold:  \n(1) Replace a manufactured dwelling in a manufactured dwelling park; \n(2) Alterations required by approved fire/life safety agreements; \n(3) Alterations related to the removal of existing architectural barriers, as \nrequired by the Americans with Disabilities Act, or as specified in Section \n1113 of the Oregon Structural Specialty Code; \n(4) Alterations required by Chapter 24.85, Interim Seismic Design Requirements \nfor Existing Buildings;  \n(5) Improvements to on-site stormwater management facilities in conformance \nwith Chapter 17.38, Drainage and Water Quality, and the Stormwater \nManagement Manual; and \n(6) Improvements made to sites in order to comply with Chapter 21.35, \nWellfield Protection Program, requirements. \n(7) Energy efficiency or renewable energy improvements that meet the Public \nPurpose Administrator incentive criteria whether or not the project applies \nfor and receives the incentive; \n(8) Landscaping required by 33.475.220;  \n(9) Removal or remediation of hazardous substances conducted under ORS \n465.200-545 & 900; and \n(10) The installation of electric bike and electric vehicle chargers and accessory \nequipment. \nb. Standards which must be met. Development not complying with the \ndevelopment standards listed below must be brought into conformance or \nreceive an adjustment.  \n(1) Landscaping and trees required for the following areas: \n• Exterior display, storage, and work activity areas; \n• Setbacks for surface parking and exterior development areas; \n• Interior parking lot landscaping; \n• Existing building setbacks;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.258 \n3/1/25 Nonconforming Situations \n \n258-11 \n• Minimum landscaped areas (where land is not used for structures, \nparking, or exterior improvements); and \n• On-site tree density standards of Subsection 11.50.050.C. \n(2) Pedestrian circulation systems, as set out in the pedestrian standards that \napply to the site; \n(3) Bicycle parking by upgrading existing racks and providing additional spaces \nin order to comply with 33.266.200, Bicycle Parking as follows: \n• Major remodeling projects must meet the standards for all bicycle \nparking; \n• Sites with accessory surface parking must meet the standards for all \nbicycle parking;  \n• In all other situations, the amounts and standards for short-term bicycle \nparking must be met. \n(4) Screening; and  \n(5) Required paving of surface parking and exterior storage and display areas. \nc. Area of required improvements. \n(1) Generally. Except as provided in D.2.c(2), below, required improvements \nmust be made for the entire site. \n(2) Exception for sites with ground leases or permanent utility easements. \nRequired improvements may be limited to a smaller area if there is a ground \nlease or permanent utility easement for the portion of the site where the \nalterations are proposed. If all of the following are met, the area of the \nground lease or permanent utility easement will be considered as a separate \nsite for purposes of required improvements. The applicant must meet the \nfollowing: \n• The signed ground lease, utility easement – or excerpts from the lease \ndocument or utility easement – must be submitted to PP&D. The \nportions of the lease or utility easement must include the following: \n− The term of the lease or utility easement. There must be at least \none year remaining on the ground lease or utility easement; and \n− A legal description of the boundaries of the lease or utility \neasement. \n• The boundaries of the ground lease or utility easement must be shown \non the site plan submitted with the building permit application; \n• The area of the lease or utility easement must include all existing and \nany proposed development that is required for, or is used exclusively \nby, uses within the area of the lease or easement; and \n• Screening is not required along the boundaries of ground leases or \nutility easement that are interior to the site. \nd. Timing and cost of required improvements. The applicant may choose one of the \nfollowing options for making the required improvements:  Chapter 33.258 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nNonconforming Situations 3/1/25 \n \n258-12 \n \n(1) Option 1. Under Option 1, required improvements must be made as part of \nthe alteration that triggers the required improvements. However, the cost \nof required improvements is limited to 10 percent of the value of the \nproposed alterations. It is the responsibility of the applicant to document \nthe value of the required improvements. When all required improvements \nare not being made, the applicant may choose which of the improvements \nlisted in Subparagraph D.2.b to make. If improvements to nonconforming \ndevelopment are also required by regulations in a plan district or overlay \nzone, those improvements must be made before those listed in \nSubparagraph D.2.b. \n(2) Option 2. Under Option 2, the required improvements may be made over \nseveral years, based on the compliance period identified in Table 258-1. \nHowever, by the end of the compliance period, the site must be brought \nfully into compliance with the standards listed in Subparagraph D.2.b. When \nthis option is chosen, the following applies: \n• Before a building permit is issued, the applicant must submit the \nfollowing to PP&D: \n− Application. An application, including a Nonconforming \nDevelopment Assessment, which identifies in writing and on a site \nplan, all development that does not meet the standards listed in \nsubparagraph D.2.b. \n− Covenant. The City-approved covenant, which is available in the \nDevelopment Services Center, is required. The covenant identifies \ndevelopment on the site that does not meet the standards listed in \nsubparagraph D.2.b, and requires the owner to bring that \ndevelopment fully into compliance with this Title. The covenant also \nspecifies the date by which the owner will bring the nonconforming \ndevelopment into full compliance. The date must be within the \ncompliance periods set out in Table 258-1. The covenant must be \nrecorded as specified in Subsection 33.700.060.B. \n• The nonconforming development identified in the Nonconforming \nDevelopment Assessment must be brought into full conformance with \nthe requirements of this Title that are in effect on the date when the \npermit application is submitted. The compliance period begins when a \nbuilding permit is issued for alterations to the site of more than \n$356,300. The compliance periods are based on the size of the site. The \ncompliance periods are identified in Table 258-1. \n• By the end of the compliance period, the applicant or owner must \nrequest that the site be certified by PP&D as in compliance with the \nstandards listed in Subparagraph D.2.b. on the date when the permit \napplication was submitted. A permit documenting full conformance \nwith these standards is required and must receive final inspection \napproval prior to PP&D certification.  \n• If certification is requested by the end of the compliance period and \nPP&D certifies the site as in compliance, a two-year grace period begins. \nThe grace period begins at the end of the compliance period, even if \nPP&D certifies the site before the end of the compliance period. During  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.258 \n3/1/25 Nonconforming Situations \n \n258-13 \nthe grace period, no upgrades to nonconforming development  \nare required. \n• If certification is not requested, or if the site is not fully in conformance \nby the end of the compliance period, no additional building permits will \nbe issued until the site is certified. \n• If the regulations referred to by Subparagraph D.2.b, or in D.2.b itself, \nare amended after the Nonconforming Development Assessment is \nreceived by PP&D, and those amendments result in development on the \nsite that was not addressed by the Assessment becoming \nnonconforming, the applicant must, at the end of the grace period, \naddress the new nonconforming development using Option 1 or Option \n2. If the applicant chooses Option 2, a separate Nonconforming \nDevelopment Assessment, covenant, and compliance period will be \nrequired for the new nonconforming development. \n \nTable 258-1 \nCompliance Periods for Option 2 \nSquare footage of site Compliance period \nLess than 200,000 sq. ft. 2 years \n200,000 sq. ft. or more, up to 500,000 sq. ft. 3 years \nMore than 500,000 sq. ft., up to 850,000 sq. ft. 4 years \nMore than 850,000 sq. ft. 5 years \nE. Loss of nonconforming development status. \n1. Discontinuance. If a nonconforming exterior development, such as an exterior storage \narea, is unused for 3 continuous years, the nonconforming rights are lost and a \nnonconforming exterior development may not be re-established. If the exterior \ndevelopment is unused for less than 3 continuous years, a nonconforming exterior \ndevelopment may be re-established, unless stated otherwise in Subsection D. above. \n2. Destruction. When a structure or other development that has nonconforming \nelements is removed or intentionally destroyed, replacement structures and other \ndevelopment must comply with the development standards of the base zone, overlay \nzone and plan district. When a structure that has non-conforming elements is partially \nor totally damaged by fire or other causes beyond the control of the owner, the \nstructure may be rebuilt using the same structure footprint. An adjustment is required \nto allow the replacement structure to be more out of compliance with the \ndevelopment standards than the previous structure. However, detached garages in \nresidential zones are subject to the provisions for accessory structures of 33.110.250 \nand 33.120.280 (Single-Dwelling and Multi-Dwelling chapters, respectively). \nF. Sites that are nonconforming in parking spaces. If changes to a use or building are made \non a site that is nonconforming in the number of maximum allowed parking spaces, existing \nparking spaces that are in excess of the maximum may be retained if none of the \ndimensions of the parking area increase. Within the existing parking area, the layout of the \nparking spaces may be redesigned and the parking area re-striped if all requirements for \nsetbacks, landscaping, and parking space and aisle dimensions in Chapter 33.266, Parking, \nLoading, and Transportation and Parking Demand Management are met.   Chapter 33.258 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nNonconforming Situations 3/1/25 \n \n258-14 \n \nG. Nonconforming signs. The regulations for nonconforming signs are stated in Title 32, Signs \nand Related Regulations.  \n33.258.075 Determination of Legal Nonconforming Status Review  \nA. Purpose. This review will determine if a use or site has legal nonconforming situation \nrights. In addition, it will determine what the current legal use is, based on the use \ncategories in Chapter 33.920.  \nB. When this review is required. Determination of Legal Nonconforming Status Review is \nrequired where a land use review or building permit is requested, and the applicant does \nnot provide standard evidence or the Director of PP&D does not find the evidence to be \nsatisfactory. (See 33.258.038). This review also may be requested by an applicant when it is \nnot required.  \nC. Procedure. Determination of Legal Nonconforming Status Reviews are processed through a \nType II procedure.  \nD. Approval criteria.  \n1. The legal status of the nonconforming situation will be certified if the review body \nfinds that: \na. The nonconforming situation would have been allowed when established; and \nb. The nonconforming situation has been maintained over time.  \n2. The review body will determine, based on the evidence, what the current legal use is, \nusing the definitions in Chapter 33.910 and the use categories in Chapter 33.920.  \n33.258.080 Nonconforming Situation Review  \nA. Procedure. A nonconforming situation review is processed through a Type II procedure. \nB. Approval criteria. The request will be approved if the review body finds that the applicant \nhas shown that all of the following approval criteria are met: \n1. With mitigation measures, there will be no net increase in overall detrimental impacts \n(over the impacts of the last legal use or development) on the surrounding area taking \ninto account factors such as: \na. The hours of operation; \nb. Vehicle trips to the site and impact on surrounding on-street parking; \nc. Noise, vibration, dust, odor, fumes, glare, and smoke; \nd. Potential for increased litter; and \ne. The amount, location, and nature of any outside displays, storage,  \nor activities; and \n2. If the nonconforming use is in an OS, R, or IR zone, and if any changes are proposed to \nthe site, the appearance of the new use or development will not lessen the residential  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.258 \n3/1/25 Nonconforming Situations \n \n258-15 \ncharacter of the OS, R, or IR zoned area. This is based on taking into account factors  \nsuch as:  \na. Building scale, placement, and facade; \nb. Parking area placement;  \nc. Buffering and the potential loss of privacy to abutting residential uses; and \nd. Lighting and signs; and \n3. If the nonconforming use is in a C, E, I, or CI zone, and if any changes are proposed to \nthe site, the appearance of the new use or development will not detract from the \ndesired function and character of the zone. \n \n(Amended by: Ord.

This chapter provides direction on how Title 33 regulations apply to occupied \nrecreational vehicles. \n \n33.260.020 When This Chapter Applies \nThis chapter applies to an occupied recreational vehicle on a site with a house, attached house, or \nmanufactured home. \n \n33.260.030 Occupied Recreational Vehicles \nAn occupied recreational vehicle is a vehicle and is not a building, structure or dwelling unit in terms of \nTitle 33. The following standards clarify how Title 33 applies to an occupied recreational vehicle. \nA. Parking. Chapter 33.266 applies to both occupied and unoccupied recreational vehicles. The \ndevelopment standards in 33.266 that apply to parking areas and recreational vehicles on a site \nalso apply to occupied recreational vehicles.  \nB. Density. Because an occupied recreational vehicle is not a dwelling unit, building or structure it \ndoes not count toward minimum or maximum density or FAR. \nC. Other development standards. Occupied recreational vehicles are not subject to development \nstandards in this Title that apply to buildings or structures. However, structures attached to an \noccupied recreational vehicle are subject to all applicable development standards in this Title. \nD. Accessory short-term rentals. An occupied recreational vehicle is prohibited from being an \naccessory short-term rental. \n \n(Added by: Ord.

These impacts include \nnoise, vibration, odors, and glare. The standards ensure that uses provide adequate control \nmeasures or locate in areas where the community is protected from health hazards and nuisances. \nThe use of objective standards provides a measurable means of determining specified off-site \nimpacts. This method protects specific industries or firms from exclusion in a zone based solely on \nthe general characteristics of similar industries in the past. \n33.262.020 Applying These Regulations \nNonresidential uses in all zones which cause off-site impacts on uses in the R, C, CI, IR, and OS zones \nare required to meet the standards of this chapter. These standards apply to the operation of the \nuse and are not reviewed for compliance at the time of building permit. Compliance with the \nstandards is subject to enforcement once the operation of the use commences. Exempted \nequipment and facilities are stated in 33.262.030 below. \n33.262.030 Exemptions \nThe off-site impact standards do not apply to machinery, equipment, and facilities which were at the \nsite and in compliance with existing regulations at the effective date of these regulations. Any new \nor additional machinery, equipment, and facilities must comply with the standards of this chapter. \nDocumentation is the responsibility of the proprietor of the use if there is any question about when \nthe equipment was brought to the site. \n33.262.040 Relationship to Other Regulations \nThe off-site impact standards are in addition to all other regulations of the City Code. The standards \ndo not replace or supersede regulations of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), relevant \ncounty regulations, or standards such as the Uniform Fire Code. \n33.262.050 Noise \nThe City noise standards are stated in Title 18, Noise Control. In addition, the Department of \nEnvironmental Quality has regulations which apply to firms adjacent to or near noise sensitive uses \nsuch as dwellings, religious institutions, schools, and hospitals.  Chapter 33.262 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nOff-Site Impacts 3/1/25 \n \n262-2 \n33.262.060 Vibration \nA. Vibration standard. Continuous, frequent, or repetitive vibrations which exceed 0.002g \npeak may not be produced. In general, this means that a person of normal sensitivities \nshould not be able to feel any vibrations. \nB. Exceptions. Vibrations from temporary construction and vehicles which leave the site (such \nas trucks, trains, airplanes and helicopters) are exempt. Vibrations lasting less than 5 \nminutes per day are also exempt. Vibrations from primarily on-site vehicles and equipment \nare not exempt. \nC. Measurement. Seismic or electronic vibration measuring equipment may be used for \nmeasurements when there are doubts about the level of vibration. \n33.262.080 Glare \nA. Glare standard. Glare is illumination caused by all types of lighting and from high \ntemperature processes such as welding or metallurgical refining. Glare may not directly, or \nindirectly from reflection, cause illumination on other properties in excess of a \nmeasurement of 0.5 foot candles of light. \nB. Strobe lights. Strobe lights visible from another property are not allowed. \n33.262.090 Measurements \nA. Measurements for compliance with these standards are made from the property line or \nwithin the property of the affected site. Measurements may be made at ground level or at \nhabitable levels of buildings. \nB. If the City does not have the equipment or expertise to measure and evaluate a specific \ncomplaint, it may request assistance from another agency or may contract with an \nindependent expert to perform such measurements. The City may accept measurements \nmade by an independent expert hired by the controller or operator of the off-site impact \nsource. If the City contracts to have measurements made and no violation is found, the City \nwill bear the expense, if any, of the measurements. If a violation is found, City expenses will \nbe charged to the violator. Nonpayment of the costs is a violation of the Code, and \nenforced through the provisions of Title 22. \n \n(Amended by: Ord.

Other titles of the City Code may regulate other aspects \nof parking and loading. \nMotor Vehicle Parking \n33.266.100 General Regulations \nA. Where the regulations apply. The regulations of this chapter apply to all parking areas in \nall zones. Parking areas include those accessory to a use, part of a Commercial Parking use, \nor for a park and ride facility in the Community Services use category. \nB. Calculations of amounts of maximum allowed parking. \n1. The maximum allowed number of parking spaces is computed based on the primary \nuses on the site except as stated in Paragraph C.2., below. When there are two or \nmore separate primary uses on a site, the allowed parking for the site is the sum of \nthe allowed parking for the individual primary uses. When there are two or more \ninstances of the same primary use on the site, the maximum allowed parking is based \non the total square footage of all those same uses added together.  Chapter 33.266 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nParking, Loading, And Transportation And Parking Demand Management 1/1/25 \n266-2 \n2. When more than 20 percent of the net building area on a site is in an accessory use, \nthe allowed parking is calculated separately for the accessory use. An example would \nbe a 40,000 square foot building with a 30,000 square foot warehouse and a 10,000 \nsquare foot accessory office area. The maximum allowed parking would be computed \nseparately for the office and warehouse uses. \n3. If the maximum number of spaces allowed is less than one, then the maximum \nnumber is automatically increased to one.  \nC. Proximity of parking to use. Parking spaces must be located on the site of the use or in \nparking areas whose closest point is within 500 feet of the site. \nD. Stacked parking. Stacked or valet parking is allowed if an attendant is present to move \nvehicles. Automated stacked parking and tandem parking for individual dwelling units are \nexempt from the attendant and guarantee requirements. The requirements for maximum \nspaces and all parking area development standards continue to apply for stacked parking. \nSee also 33.266.140.  \nE. Office of Transportation review. The Office of Transportation reviews the layout of parking \nareas for compliance with the curb cut and access restrictions of Section 17.28.110, \nDriveways – Permits and Conditions. \n33.266.110 Required Carpool and Electric Vehicle Parking  \nA. Purpose. These regulations encourage carpooling and electric vehicles by requiring that, \nwhen parking spaces are provided, enough of the spaces are reserved for carpool use and \nwill accommodate electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Provision of carpool parking, and \nlocating it close to the building entrance, will encourage carpool use. Providing \nopportunities to install electric vehicle chargers within parking areas encourages electric \nvehicles as an alternative to vehicles that burn fossil fuels. \nB. Required carpool parking spaces. For office, industrial, and institutional uses where there \nare more than 20 parking spaces on the site, the following standards must be met: \n1. Five spaces or five percent of the parking spaces on site, whichever is less, must be \nreserved for carpool use before 9:00 AM on weekdays. More spaces may be reserved, \nbut they are not required. \n2. The spaces must be those closest to the building entrance or elevator, but not closer \nthan the spaces for disabled parking and those signed for exclusive customer use.  \n3. Signs must be posted indicating these spaces are reserved for carpool use before  \n9:00 AM on weekdays. \nC. Required electric vehicle charging spaces. For Commercial Parking uses and for sites with 5 \nor more dwelling units, the following standards must be met:  \n1. Commercial Parking. For Commercial Parking uses, at least 20 percent of the total \nnumber of parking spaces must include electrical conduit adjacent to the spaces that \nwill allow for the installation of at least a Level 2 electric vehicle charger. \n2. In buildings with five or more dwelling units, if parking spaces are provided for any of \nthe dwelling units, the following standards apply:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.266 \n1/1/25 Parking, Loading, And Transportation And Parking Demand Management \n \n266-3 \na. If between one and six spaces are provided for dwelling units, 100 percent of the \nspaces must include electrical conduit adjacent to the spaces that will allow for \ninstallation of at least a Level 2 electric vehicle charger. \nb. If seven or more spaces are provided for dwelling units, 50 percent, or six, \nwhichever is greater of the parking spaces provided must include electrical \nconduit adjacent to the spaces that will allow for installation of at least a Level 2 \nelectric vehicle charger. \n33.266.115 Maximum Allowed Parking Spaces \nA. Purpose. Limiting the number of spaces allowed promotes efficient use of land, enhances \nurban form, encourages use of alternative modes of transportation, provides for better \npedestrian movement, and protects air and water quality.  \nB. Maximum number of parking spaces allowed. Regulations in a plan district or overlay zone \nmay supersede the regulations in this Subsection. Park and ride facilities are exempt from \nparking maximums. \n1. Surface parking. Where more than 25 percent of the parking accessory to a use is on \nsurface parking lots, the maximum number of parking spaces allowed is stated in \nTables 266-1 and 266-2 and apply to both the structured and surface parking. Parking \naccessory to a use includes accessory parking that is on- and off-site. \n2. Structured parking. Where 75 percent or more of the parking accessory to a use is in \nstructured parking, both the structured and surface parking are regulated as follows. \nParking accessory to a use includes accessory parking that is on- and off-site:  \na. Generally. The maximum number of parking spaces allowed is 125 percent of the \namount stated in Tables 266-1 and 266-2, except as provided in Subparagraph \nB.2.b; \nb. Parking accessory to Medical Centers and Colleges. The maximum parking \nallowed that is accessory to Medical Centers and Colleges is stated in  \nTables 266-1 and 266-2.  \n3. Exception in the EG and I zones. In the EG and I zones, there is no maximum number \nof accessory parking spaces for either structured or surface parking where both \nSubparagraphs B.3.a. and b. are met, and either Subparagraph B.3.c. or d. is met: \na. The site is at least eight acres in area; \nb. The site is located more than 1/2 mile from a transit stop or station with 20-\nminute peak-hour light rail or streetcar service; and  \nc.

Purpose. The development standards promote vehicle areas that are safe and attractive for \nmotorists and pedestrians. Vehicle area locations are restricted in some zones to promote \nthe desired character of those zones.  \n Together with the transit street building setback standards in the base zone chapters, the \nvehicle area location regulations: \n \n Chapter 33.266 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nParking, Loading, And Transportation And Parking Demand Management 1/1/25 \n266-10 \n• Provide pedestrian access that is protected from auto traffic;  \n• Create an environment that is inviting to pedestrians and transit users, especially on \ntransit streets and in Pedestrian Districts; \n• Limit the prominence of vehicle areas along street frontages and create a strong \nrelationship between buildings and the sidewalk;  \n• Create a sense of enclosure on transit and pedestrian street frontages; and \n• Limit the size of paved parking area and the type of paving material allowed in order to \nlimit increases in temperature associated with asphalt and reduce impacts from urban \nheat islands. \n The parking area layout, setback, and landscaping standards are intended to promote safe \ncirculation within the parking area, provide for the effective management of stormwater \nrunoff from vehicle areas, and provide for convenient entry and exit of vehicles. The layout, \nsetback, and landscaping standards: \n• Improve and soften the appearance of parking areas;  \n• Reduce the visual impact of parking areas from sidewalks, streets, and especially from \nadjacent residential zones;  \n• Provide flexibility to reduce the visual impacts of small residential parking lots; \n• Direct traffic in parking areas;  \n• Shade and cool parking areas;  \n• Reduce the amount and rate of stormwater runoff from vehicle areas; \n• Reduce pollution and temperature of stormwater runoff from vehicle areas;  \n• Decrease airborne and waterborne pollution;  \n• Provide flexibility for locating electric vehicle chargers and equipment while limiting \ntheir impact on adjacent streets and lots; and \n• Generate solar power to offset the impacts of surface parking areas.  \nB. Where these standards apply. The standards of this section apply to all vehicle areas, \nexcept for residential vehicle areas subject to the standards of 33.266.120. \nC. On-site locations and size of vehicle areas.  \n1. Location of vehicle areas. The allowed on-site location of all vehicle areas is stated in \nTable 266-3. Additionally, on sites in single dwelling zones or multi-dwelling zones that \nabut an alley and are 10,000 square feet or less in total site area, vehicle area may \nonly be accessed from the alley. \n2. Building setbacks for structures that contain vehicle areas.  \na. Structures that contain vehicle areas are subject to the building setbacks of the \nbase zone, where exiting in a forward motion is provided. \nb. Structured parking that does not allow exiting in a forward motion in R Zones is \nsubject to the garage entrance setback standard of the base zone. \nc. Structured parking that does not allow exiting in a forward motion in C, E, I, CI, or \nIR zones must be set back 18 feet from the street lot line. \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.266 \n1/1/25 Parking, Loading, And Transportation And Parking Demand Management \n \n266-11 \n3. Frontage limitation. \na. The standard of this Subparagraph applies outside the Central City plan district in \nthe R20 through R2.5, RM1, RM2, RM3, RM4, and RMP zones. No more than 40 \npercent of the frontage on a street may be used for vehicle areas. On sites with \nmore than one street frontage, this standard applies to the street with the \nhighest transit designation. If two streets have the same highest transit \nclassification, the applicant may choose on which street to meet the standard. \nSites where there is less than 100 square feet of net building area are exempt \nfrom this standard. \nb. The standard of this Paragraph applies outside the Central City plan district in the \nRX, CR, CM1, CM2, CM3, CE, CX, EG1, EX, CI, and IR zones. Where vehicle areas \nare adjacent to a transit street or a street in a Pedestrian District, no more than \n50 percent of the frontage on the transit street or street in a Pedestrian District \nmay be used for vehicle areas. Sites where there is less than 100 square feet of \nnet building area are exempt from this standard. \n4. Surface parking and driveway paving limitations.  \na. In the RM1 through RM4 zones, the following parking area and driveway size and \npaving material limitations apply: \n(1) No more than 30 percent of total site area may be paved or used for surface \nparking and driveways; and \n(2) Asphalt paving for surface parking and driveways may not cover more than \n15 percent of total site area. \nb. On sites with more than 65,000 square feet of net building area, surface parking \nis limited to an amount equal to the total net building area on site. \nD. Improvements. \n1. Paving. In order to control dust and mud, all vehicle areas must be paved. However, \nsome portions of individual parking spaces may be landscaped per the standards of \nParagraph F.4, below. \n2. Striping. All parking areas, except for stacked parking, must be striped in conformance \nwith the parking dimension standards of Subsection F. below.  \n3. Protective curbs around landscaping. All perimeter and interior landscaped areas must \nhave protective curbs along the edges. Curbs separating landscaped areas from \nparking areas may allow stormwater runoff to pass through them. Tire stops, bollards, \nor other protective barriers may be used at the front ends of parking spaces. Curbs \nmay be perforated or have gaps or breaks. Trees must have adequate protection from \ncar doors as well as car bumpers. \n   Chapter 33.266 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nParking, Loading, And Transportation And Parking Demand Management 1/1/25 \n266-12 \nTable 266-3 \nLocation of Vehicle Areas [1], [2] \nZone General Standard Exception for Through \nLots and Sites with Three \nFrontages \n \nException for Full-Block \nSites \nOS, RF, EG2, I  No restrictions. \n \nRMP, IR, CE, EG1, CI; sites \nin RM1, RM2, and RM3 \nthat are more than \n10,000 square feet in \ntotal area; sites in CM1, \nCM2, and CM3 that are \nmore than 2 acres in total \narea \nVehicle areas not allowed \nbetween the portion of \nthe building that complies \nwith the maximum street \nsetback and the transit \nstreet or streets in a \nPedestrian District.  \nMay have vehicle areas \nbetween the portion of \nthe building that complies \nwith the maximum street \nsetback and one Local \nService Transit Street.  \nMay have vehicle areas \nbetween the portion of \nthe building that complies \nwith the maximum street \nsetback and two Local \nService Transit Streets.  \nR20-R2.5, RM4, RX, CX, \nCR, EX;, sites in RM1, \nRM2, and RM3 that are \n10,000 square feet or less \nin total area; sites in CM1, \nCM2, and CM3 that are 2 \nacres or less in total area \nNot allowed between a \nbuilding and any street.  \n \nMay have vehicle areas \nbetween the building and \none Local Service Transit \nStreet.  \nMay have vehicle areas \nbetween the building and \ntwo Local Service Transit \nStreets.  \nNotes: \n[1] Driveways that provide a straight-line connection between the street and a parking area inside a building are \nnot subject to these regulations. \n[2] Vehicle areas that are separated from a street by a building are not subject to these regulations.  \n \nE.

The chargers, accessory equipment, and protective barriers cannot be located more \nthan 2 feet into required perimeter landscaping areas; and \n2. The accessory equipment may be located anywhere on site but must be screened \nfrom the street and adjacent residential zones by walls, fences, or vegetation. \nScreening must comply with at least the L2 or F2 standards of Chapter 33.248, \nLandscaping and Screening, and be tall enough to screen the equipment.  \n33.266.140 Stacked Parking Areas \nStacked parking areas must comply with all of the development standards of Section 33.266.130 \nabove, except for those standards superseded by this section. \nA. Perimeter setbacks and landscaping. Parking areas must be set back from streets at least 4 \nfeet and landscaped to at least the L2 level. \nB. Striping and layout. Parking areas used exclusively for stacked parking need not be striped \nor meet the layout standards of Subsection F. above. Stacked parking areas which will allow \nparking at some times without attendants must be striped in conformance with the layout \nstandards of Subsection F. above. \nC. Interior landscaping for surface parking areas. The minimum interior landscaping \nrequirement for surface parking areas is one tree per 5,000 square feet of parking area. If \nsurrounded by cement, the tree planting area must have a minimum dimension of 4 ft. If \nsurrounded by asphalt, the tree planting area must have a minimum dimension of 3 ft. \nTrees must be protected from potential damage by vehicles through the use of bollards, \ncurbs, wheel stops, or other physical barriers. \n33.266.150 Vehicles in Residential Zones \nA. Purpose. The regulations of this section are intended to reinforce community standards \nand to promote an attractive residential appearance in the City's neighborhoods. The size, \nnumber, and location of parked and stored vehicles in residential zones are regulated in \norder to preserve the appearance of neighborhoods as predominantly residential in \ncharacter. Since parking lots and outdoor storage are not intended to be primary activities \nin residential zones, these activities should constitute no more than a minimal intrusion on \nany residential area.  \nB. Where these regulations apply. These regulations apply to all residential uses in all  \nR zones. \nC. Parking of passenger vehicles and light trucks. Passenger vehicles and light trucks may be \nparked in any allowed parking area. \nD. Parking of medium and heavy trucks. \n1. The parking or storage of medium and heavy trucks and equipment is prohibited, \nexcept for motor homes and pickup trucks in the medium truck category. \n2. Motor homes in medium truck category may be parked in allowed parking areas \nexcept they may not be parked between the front lot line and the building line.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.266 \n1/1/25 Parking, Loading, And Transportation And Parking Demand Management \n \n266-21 \n3. Fire trucks and emergency vehicles are allowed if they are parked within a completely \nenclosed building.  \nE. Utility trailers and accessory recreational vehicles. Utility trailers and accessory \nrecreational vehicles may be parked in other allowed parking areas, except they may not \nbe parked or stored between the front lot line and the building line. \nF. Inoperable vehicles. The outdoor accumulation and storage of inoperable, neglected, or \ndiscarded vehicles is regulated by Section 29.20.010 of Title 29, Property and  \nMaintenance Regulations. \nG.  Vehicle service and repair. Service and repair of vehicles not owned by and registered to a \nresident of the site is prohibited. Vehicles may be serviced and repaired if: \n1. The vehicles are owned by and registered to residents of the site; and \n2. The service and repair is minor. Minor service and repair includes tune-ups, \nreplacement and servicing of oil and other fluids, and replacement and adjustment of \nminor parts such as tires, hoses, belts, filters, fuses, and similar items. It does not \ninclude: body and fender repair and replacement; painting; engine or transmission \nremoval or replacement; or any work using welders, torches, or air-driven power \ntools. \nOR \n3. The vehicles are owned by and registered to a resident of the site; and \n4. All work occurs within a completely enclosed building; and  \n5. The off-site impact standards of Chapter 33.262 are met.  \nBicycle Parking \n33.266.200 Minimum Required Bicycle Parking \nA. Purpose. Bicycle parking is required for most use categories to encourage the use of \nbicycles by providing secure and convenient places to park bicycles. These regulations \nensure adequate short and long-term bicycle parking based on the demand generated by \ndifferent uses. Minimum bicycle parking facilities are based on the City’s mode split goals, \nwhile acknowledging the usage rates for different uses. These regulations will help meet \nthe City’s goal that 25 percent of all trips be made by bicycle, while still acknowledging that \nto meet the citywide goal the bicycle mode split will vary by geographic area. \n \nB. Number of spaces required.  \n1. The required minimum number of bicycle parking spaces for each use category is \nshown in Table 266-6. No bicycle parking is required for uses not listed. Minimum \nbicycle parking is calculated on a geographic hierarchy based on the current and \nfuture bicycle usage. Standard A in Table 266-6 applies to the areas shown as Standard \nA on Map 266-1. Standard B in Table 266-6 applies to all other areas of the city. \n2. The required minimum number of bicycle parking spaces is based on the primary uses \non a site. When there are two or more separate primary uses on a site, the required  Chapter 33.266 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nParking, Loading, And Transportation And Parking Demand Management 1/1/25 \n266-22 \nbicycle parking for the site is the sum of the required parking for each primary use. \n \nTable 266-6 \nMinimum Required Bicycle Parking Spaces [1] \n  Long-term Spaces Short-term Spaces

Purpose. These standards ensure that required bicycle parking is designed so people of all \nages and abilities can access the bicycle parking and securely lock their bicycle without \nundue inconvenience. Bicycle parking is in areas that are reasonably safeguarded from \ntheft and accidental damage. The standards allow for a variety of bicycle types, including \nbut not limited to standard bicycles, tricycles, hand cycles, tandems, electric motor assisted \ncycles and cargo bicycles. Long-term bicycle parking is in secure, weather protected \nfacilities and is intended for building and site occupants, and others who need bicycle \nparking for several hours or longer. Short-term bicycle parking is located in publicly \naccessible, highly visible locations that serve the main entrance of a building. Short-term \nbicycle parking is visible to pedestrians and bicyclists on the street and is intended for \nbuilding and site visitors.  \nB. Where these standards apply. The standards of Subsection C and D apply to required long-\nterm bicycle parking, and the standards of Subsection C and E apply to required short-term \nbicycle parking.   \nC. Standards for all bicycle parking. The Bureau of Transportation maintains a bicycle parking \nhandbook that includes information on rack standards, siting guidelines and other \nstandards of this code chapter. Long-term and short-term bicycle parking must be provided \nin lockers or racks that meet the following standards:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.266 \n1/1/25 Parking, Loading, And Transportation And Parking Demand Management \n \n266-25 \n1.

Purpose. A minimum number of loading spaces are required to ensure adequate areas for \nloading for larger uses and developments. These regulations ensure that the appearance of \nloading areas will be consistent with that of parking areas. The regulations ensure that \naccess to and from loading facilities will not have a negative effect on the traffic safety or \nother transportation functions of the abutting right-of-way. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to all required and \nnon-required loading areas. \nC. Number of loading spaces.  \n1. Buildings where all of the floor area is in Household Living uses must meet the \nstandards of this Paragraph. \na. One loading space meeting Standard B is required where there are more than 50 \ndwelling units in the building and the site abuts a street that is not a streetcar \nalignment or light rail alignment. \nb. One loading space meeting Standard B is required where there are more than 20 \ndwelling units in a building located on a site whose only street frontage is on a \nstreetcar alignment or light rail alignment. \nc. One loading space meeting Standard A or two loading spaces meeting Standard B \nare required when there are more than 100 dwelling units in the building. This \nstandard does not apply until January 1, 2029. \n Chapter 33.266 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nParking, Loading, And Transportation And Parking Demand Management 1/1/25 \n266-36 \n2. Buildings where any of the floor area is in uses other than Household Living must meet \nthe standards of this Paragraph. \na. Buildings with any amount of net building area in Household Living and with less \nthan 20,000 square feet of floor area in uses other than Household Living are \nsubject to the standards in C.1. above. \nb. One loading space meeting Standard A is required for buildings with at least \n20,000 and up to 50,000 square feet of net building area in uses other than \nHousehold Living. \nc. Two loading spaces meeting Standard A are required for buildings with more \nthan 50,000 square feet of net building area in uses other than Household Living. \nD. Size of loading spaces. Required loading spaces must meet the standards of  \nthis subsection. \n1. Standard A: the loading space must be at least 35 feet long, 10 feet wide, and have a \nclearance of 13 feet. \n2. Standard B: The loading space must be at least 18 feet long, 9 feet wide, and have a \nclearance of 10 feet.  \nE. Placement, setbacks and landscaping. Loading areas must comply with the setback and \nperimeter landscaping standards stated in Table 266-8 below.

Purpose. Transportation and parking demand management (TDM) encompasses a variety \nof strategies to encourage more efficient use of the existing transportation system, and \nreduce reliance on the personal automobile. This is achieved by encouraging people \nthrough education, outreach, financial incentives, and pricing to choose other modes, \nshare rides, travel outside peak times, and telecommute, among other methods. Effective \nTDM also incorporates management of parking demand. Transportation and parking \ndemand management strategies help reduce traffic congestion, reduce the amount of \nmoney that must be spent to expand transportation system capacity, improve air quality, \nand ensure road capacity is available for those who need it most. \nB. Transportation and parking demand management in the commercial/mixed use and multi-\ndwelling zones. In the commercial/mixed use and multi-dwelling zones, a TDM plan is \nrequired when new development includes a building with more than 10 dwelling units, or \nan alteration to existing development includes the addition of more than 10 dwelling units \nwithin a building. Sites in the Central City plan district are exempt from this requirement. \nTo meet the TDM standard, the applicant must choose one of the following:  \n1. Go through the Transportation Impact review process set out in chapter 33.852; or  \n2. Meet the objective standards of Title 17.107 as verified by the Portland Bureau of \nTransportation. \n33.266.420 Transportation Impact Review in the Campus Institutional Zones \nDevelopment on a site zoned CI with a College or Medical Center use must conform to an approved \nTransportation Impact review. Development that is not in conformance with an approved \nTransportation Impact review requires Transportation Impact review when the development: \nA. Increases the net building area on the campus by more than 20,000 square  \nfeet; or  \nB. Increases the number of parking spaces on the campus by more than 4. \n \n(Amended by: Ord.

Planned Development provides a master planning mechanism for allowing additional \nhousing types and uses, the transfer of density and floor area to different portions of a site, and \nacross internal zoning boundaries, and bonus floor area and increased height on large sites in \ncommercial/mixed use zones. In this case, the flexibility is allowed when the development includes \nfeatures that provide public benefits. \nThese regulations allow flexibility, and in some cases increased intensity of development, beyond \nthat allowed by other chapters of this Title, if the proposed development is well-designed and can \nbe successfully integrated into the neighborhood and provides public benefits. Overall, a Planned \nDevelopment is intended to promote: \n• High quality design that is integrated into the broader urban fabric, and complements \nexisting character within the site and adjacent to the site; \n• Development that is pedestrian-oriented, with a strong orientation towards transit and \nmultimodal transportation alternatives; \n• Building bulk, height, and orientation that ensures that light and air is accessible within the \npublic realm, and that public view corridors are protected;  \n• A safe and vibrant public realm, with buildings and uses that are oriented to activate key \npublic gathering spaces, be they public open space, transit stations, or the Willamette River;  \n• Open space areas that include gathering spaces and passive and/or active recreation \nopportunities; \n• Affordable housing; and \n• Energy efficient development. \n33.270.020 Relationship to Other Regulations  \nA.  Flexibility. Approval of a Planned Development allows certain kinds of flexibility for \ndevelopment in residential zones and commercial/mixed use zones. Some of the flexibility \nallowed by Planned Developments may also be allowed under other provisions of this Title. \nWhere such situations exist, the applicant may choose which provision to apply. \n  Chapter 33.270 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nPlanned Development 10/1/24 \n \n270-2 \n \nB. Density. Adjustments to density regulations are prohibited. \n1. Maximum dwelling unit density. \na. RF. In the RF zone, maximum density is expressed as a number of lots. Maximum \ndensity for the RF zone is specified in 33.610.100. Maximum density can be met \nin the Planned Development by providing the same number of dwelling units.  \nb. R20 through R2.5. In the R20 through R2.5 zones, maximum density is calculated \nas follows: \n(1) If the Planned Development is in the Constrained Sites Overlay or does not \nqualify to use the triplex or fourplex provisions of 33.110.265.E, maximum \ndensity is calculated as follows:   \n \nMaximum number of lots allowed as specified for maximum density C in \n33.610.100; \nx 2  \n= Maximum number of dwelling units allowed. \n(2) For all other Planned Developments, maximum density is calculated as \nfollows:   \n \nMaximum number of lots allowed as specified for maximum density C in \n33.610.100; \nx 4  \n= Maximum number of dwelling units allowed. \n2. Minimum density. Minimum density must be met in the Planned Development. \nMinimum density for single-dwelling zones is expressed as a number of lots. Minimum \ndensity can be met in a Planned Development by providing the same number of \ndwelling units. Minimum density for single-dwelling zones is stated in 33.610.100. \nMinimum density for all other zones is stated in the base zone chapters. \nC.  Land Divisions. A Planned Development may be the only land use review requested for a \nsite, or may be part of a proposal for a Land Division. Certain site conditions or aspects of a \nproposal require a Land Division, including situations where a tract is required (such as \nwhen there is floodway on the site), or where rights-of-way are requested or required. \nMaximum dwelling unit density in a Planned Development does not equate to maximum \nlot density in a Land Division. \n33.270.100 Additional Allowed Uses and Development \nIn addition to the housing types and uses allowed by other chapters of this Title, the following uses \nand development may be requested through Planned Development Review. More than one of these \nelements may be requested: \nA.  Attached houses. Attached houses may be requested in the RF through R5 zones;  \nB.  Duplexes. Duplexes may be requested in the RF through R2.5 zones;  \nC.  Attached duplexes. Attached duplexes may be requested in the RF through R2.5 zones;   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.270 \n10/1/24 Planned Development \n \n270-3 \nD. Triplexes. Triplexes may be requested in the RF through R2.5 zones; \nE. Fourplexes. Fourplexes may be requested in the RF through R2.5 zones; \nF.  Multi-dwelling structures. Multi-dwelling structures may be requested in the RF through \nR2.5 zones; \nG.  Multi-dwelling development. Proposals to allow multi-dwelling development on a lot may \nbe requested in RF through R2.5 zones; \nH.  Modification of site-related development standards. Modification of site-related \ndevelopment standards that are not prohibited from being adjusted may be requested \nthrough a Planned Development.  \nI.  Alternative residential dimensions. Proposals for lots that do not meet the lot dimension \nregulations for land divisions may be requested in the RF through RM4 zones. \nJ.  Commercial uses. Commercial uses that are allowed in the CM1 zone may be requested in \nthe RF through RM2 zones;  \nK. Additional height and FAR. For sites in the CM2, CM3, CE, and CX zones outside of the \nCentral City and Gateway plan districts that are greater than 2 acres in size, additional \nheight and FAR may be requested through a Planned Development as specified in \n33.130.212.E, Planned Development Bonus, and Table 130-3;  \nL. New dwelling units. New dwelling units may be requested on lots that are zoned multi-\ndwelling and are less than 90 feet wide; \nM. Transfer of development within a site. Transfer of development rights across zoning lines \nwithin the site may be proposed as follows:  \n1. RF through R2.5 zones.  \na. Dwelling units. If the site is located in more than one zone, and all the zones are \nRF through R2.5, the total number of dwelling units allowed is calculated by \nadding up the number of dwelling units allowed by each zone. The dwelling units \nmay be placed without regard to zone boundaries.  \nb. Floor area. If the site is located in more than one zone, and all the zones are R7 \nthrough R2.5, the total amount of floor area allowed is calculated by adding up \nthe amount of floor area allowed by each zone. The floor area may be placed \nwithout regard to zone boundaries. \n2. RM1 through RX zones. If the site is located in more than one zone, and the zones are \nRM1 through RX, the total amount of floor area allowed is calculated by adding up the \namount of floor area allowed by each zone. The floor area may be placed without \nregard to zone boundaries. \n3. C, E, I, CI, and IR zones. If the site is located in more than one zone, and all the zones \nare C, E, I, CI, and IR zones, the total amount of floor area allowed is calculated by \nadding up the amount of floor area allowed by each zone. The floor area may be \nplaced without regard to zone boundaries.  Chapter 33.270 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nPlanned Development 10/1/24 \n \n270-4 \n \n4. All zones. If the site is located in more than one zone, and at least one of the zones is \nRF through R2.5, and at least one of the zones is RM1 through RX, C, or EX, then the \ntotal number of dwelling units allowed is calculated as follows: \na. The number of units allowed on the RF through R2.5 portion of the site is \ncalculated in terms of dwelling units;  \nb. The number of units allowed on the other portion of the site is calculated in \nterms of floor area; The floor area calculation is converted to dwelling units at \nthe rate of 1 dwelling unit per 1,000 square feet of floor area;  \nc. The two dwelling unit numbers are added together, and may be placed without \nregard to zone boundaries. \nN. Transfer of development between sites. Sites that are eligible to transfer development \nrights to another site are designated in other chapters of this Title. Where such transfers \nrequire a Planned Development, both the sending and receiving sites must be part of a \nPlanned Development.  \n33.270.110 Limitations on Residential Uses and Development \nThe following limitations apply to Planned Developments proposed in EG or I Zones: \nA. Industrial zones. Residential uses and development are prohibited in industrial zones. \nUsing floor area transferred from industrial zones for residential uses is prohibited in all \nzones. \nB. EG1 and EG2 zones. Residential uses and development are prohibited in EG1 and EG2 \nzones. Using floor area transferred from EG1 or EG2 zones for residential uses is prohibited \nin all zones.  \n33.270.200 Additional requirements for Planned Developments in the R20 through R5 Zones  \nA. Where this standard applies. In the R20 through R5 zones, unless exempted by Subsection \nC., the standards of this section apply when the total number of proposed dwelling units is \nat least 75 percent of the maximum number of dwelling units allowed through the Planned \nDevelopment,  \nB.

The easement \nmust be recorded with the County Recorder/Auditor’s Office as part of recording an approved land \nuse review decision, and finalized prior to obtaining a final certificate of occupancy. The land may be \ndonated to the City instead of granting an easement when the standards of Section 33.272.100 are \nmet. Trails shown adjacent to public rights-of-way may be constructed in the public right-of-way, \nsubject to approval from the Portland Bureau of Transportation. \n33.272.040 Construction of Trails \nA. Single-dwelling zones. The construction of the major public trail in single-dwelling \nresidential zones is only required for land divisions and Planned Developments. \nConstruction of the trail is not required as part of development on an existing single-\ndwelling lot. \nB. All other zones. Construction of the major public trail is required on lands designated with \na major public trail symbol on the zoning maps in any of the following situations: \n1. When there is new development; \n2. When exterior alterations to existing development are 35 percent or greater of the \nassessed improvement value of the total improvements on the site; or  \n3. When there is a land division or Planned Development. \nC. Prior to certificate of occupancy. The trail must be constructed prior to the issuance of a \ncertificate of occupancy, unless the site is eligible for the trust fund provisions of \n33.515.260.B, or the special timing provisions of 33.510.253.D.4. \n33.272.050 Trail standards.  \nA major public trail must comply with the standards of Portland Parks and Recreation for \nrecreational trails or, where the trail is located in a public right-of-way, it must comply with the \nstandards of the Portland Bureau of Transportation. \n33.272.060 Use of Trail \nPublic use and conduct on the major public trail are subject to the regulations in Chapter 12, \nProhibited Conduct, of Title 20, Parks and Recreation; and Chapter 50, Columbia South Shore Slough \nTrail of Title 20 except as otherwise limited by the terms of an easement between the applicant and \nthe City.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.272 \n8/10/20 Major Public Trails \n \n272-3 \n33.272.070 Hours of Use \nThe major public trail and access paths must be open to the public between the hours of 5 a.m. and \n10 p.m., except as otherwise specified by the terms of an easement between the applicant and  \nthe City. \n33.272.080 Trespass \nNothing in this chapter is intended to authorize public use of private property. Public use of private \nproperty is a trespass unless appropriate easements and access have been acquired. \n33.272.090 Trail Maintenance and Liability \nA. City maintenance. The City will accept maintenance and liability, similar to its \nresponsibilities for City-owned park property, for a major public trail segment if the City \nEngineer or the Director of Portland Parks and Recreation finds all of the following: \n1.

This chapter provides \nregulations for schools and school sites located throughout the City's neighborhoods. The \nregulations acknowledge that school sites provide an important community resource and that \ntraditionally a wide variety of activities take place at school sites. The regulations also reflect the fact \nthat there is a constant change in uses, programs, and buildings as school districts respond to \nchanging demographics and educational innovations. At the same time, the regulations protect \nsurrounding uses from negative impacts by providing a forum for the review of major changes to \nuses or buildings. \n33.281.020 Relationship to Base Zone and Conditional Use Regulations \nThe base zone chapters indicate whether school uses are allowed by right, are conditional uses, or \nare prohibited. In OS, R, and IR zones, schools are generally regulated as conditional uses. In C and E \nzones, schools are generally allowed by right. In I and CI zones, schools are prohibited. This chapter \nprovides supplemental information and regulations specific to school uses and school sites. The \nrequirements of the base zone apply unless superseded by the regulations in this chapter. In \nsituations where the use is regulated as a conditional use, the regulations that apply are located in \nthis chapter, except for the conditional use approval criteria, which are in 33.815.105. If a school site \nhas previous conditions of approval, the specific conditions take precedence over the threshold \nlevels of review in this chapter.  Chapter 33.281  Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSchools and School Sites  6/30/23 \n281-2 \nRegulations in OS, R, and IR zones \n33.281.030 Review Thresholds for School Uses \nThis section states when a conditional use is required and the type of procedure used for changes to \nschool uses in the OS, R, and IR zones.  \nA. New school use. The creation of a school use on a site that does not have a school use or is \nnot a school site is reviewed through the Type III procedure. \nB. Change of grade levels. Removing grades from any school is allowed. Adding grades is \nallowed or a conditional use, as specified in Table 281-1. \n \nTable 281-1 \nRegulations for Adding Grades \nIf a school has the following grades: Regulation for adding the following grades: \n Allowed CU required  \n \nAny grade K-8 \n \nAny grade K-8 Any grade 9-12 (Type III) \nAny grade 9-12 Any grade 9-12 \n \nAny grade K-8 (Type II) \nAny grade K-8 AND  \nAny grade 9-12 \nAny grade K-12 — \n \nC. Modifying an existing school use at the same school level. Program changes within the \nschool use are allowed by right. This includes the addition of special education programs \n(such as remedial or talented and gifted (TAG) programs), latch key programs, early \nchildhood education programs, or similar programs within the level of the school use. The \naddition of community school programs or evening programs is also allowed by right as \nlong as the level of the school use does not change. \nD. Changes in enrollment and staffing. Changes in the number of students enrolled and the \nnumber and classification of staff are allowed without review except where a conditional \nuse review is required by Subsections 33.281.050.B or C. \n33.281.040 Review Thresholds for Other Uses \nThis section states when a conditional use is required for changes to non-school uses on school sites \nin the OS, R, and IR zones, and the type of procedure used when a conditional use review is \nrequired.  \nA. Purpose. This section allows additional conditional uses on school sites over that normally \nallowed by the base zones. This is in recognition of the special nature of school sites and \nthe necessity to allow interim uses to allow school districts to maintain sites for future \nschool uses. The additional uses are limited to uses which provide a public service and \nwhich can be accommodated on the site with minimal disruption to the site and \nsurrounding area. Certain office uses may also be allowed. \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.281 \n6/30/23  Schools and School Sites \n \n281-3 \nB. Other uses on school sites.  \n1. Daycare, Community Service, Community Gardens, Market Gardens, and nonprofit or \nsocial service Office uses are allowed at a school site. However, these uses must \ncomply with the parking requirements in Chapter 33.266, Parking and Loading. In \naddition, any exterior recreation areas including playgrounds and fields must be \nmaintained and open to the public at times when the use is not occupying the areas. \n2. Parks and Open Area uses at school sites are subject to the use regulations of the base \nzone, plan district and overlay zone. Recreational fields used for organized sports are \nsubject to the regulations of 33.279, Recreational Fields for Organized Sports. \n3. Change to another conditional use or the addition of another conditional use in a \ndifferent use category, except as allowed by Paragraph B.1. or B.2. above, are \nreviewed through a Type III procedure. \n4. Office uses, other than nonprofit or social service offices allowed by Paragraph B.1., \nabove, are reviewed though a Type III procedure. \n5. Commercial or industrial uses other than those allowed in Paragraphs B.1. and B.4., \nabove, are reviewed through a Type III procedure. The operators of the uses must be \nnonprofit, governmental, or social service agencies. The uses may only be in portions \nof buildings that are already designed to accommodate the proposed use. For \nexample, a social service agency could request approval to run a vocational training \nprogram in the auto shop portion of a building on the site. \n6. Adding an allowed use may or may not require a conditional use depending on the \nproposed changes to development on the site. See Section 33.281.050. \n33.281.050 Review Thresholds for Development \nThis section states when development related to schools and on school sites in the OS, R, and IR \nzones is allowed, when a conditional use review is required, and the type of procedure used. \nRecreational fields used for organized sports are subject to Chapter 33.279, Recreational Fields for  \nOrganized Sports. \nA. Allowed. Alterations to the site that meet all of the following are allowed without a \nconditional use review. \n1. The addition of new outdoor recreation areas, or changes to existing outdoor \nrecreation areas; \n2. The demolition and replacement of up to 25 percent of the existing net building area \non the site;  \n3. The addition of up to 2,000 square feet of new net building area to the site; \n4.

Fences, handicap \naccess ramps, on-site pedestrian circulation systems, Community Gardens, Market \nGardens, electric vehicle chargers and equipment, bicycle parking and increases \nallowed by Paragraphs A.6 and A.9 are exempt from this limitation; \n5. Changes that do not result in a net gain or loss of site area;  Chapter 33.281  Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSchools and School Sites  6/30/23 \n281-4 \n6. The alteration will not result in an individual or cumulative loss or gain in the number \nof parking spaces, except as follows: \na. On sites with 5 or more parking spaces, up to 1 space or 4 percent of the total \nnumber of existing parking spaces, whichever is greater, may be removed; \nhowever, the removal of more than 5 spaces requires a conditional use review. \nParking spaces removed to create accessible spaces as specified in the Oregon \nStructural Specialty Code are exempt from this limitation; \nb. Up to 1 space or 4 percent of the total number of existing parking spaces, \nwhichever is greater, may be added; however, the addition of more than 5 \nspaces requires a conditional use review; and \nc. Any cumulative loss or gain of parking allowed in A.6.a or A.6.b is measured from \nthe time the use became a conditional use, or the last conditional use review of \nthe use, whichever is most recent, to the present. \n7. The alteration meets one of the following: \na. Complies with the development standards of this Title; or \nb. Does not comply with the development standards of this Title, but an adjustment \nor modification to the development standards has been approved through a land \nuse review; \n8. The alteration complies with all previous conditions of approval; \n9. The addition of roof-mounted solar panels that meet the requirements of the base \nzone, and ground mounted solar panels.   \nB. Type II. A Type II review is required when the following individual or cumulative alterations \nare proposed. The increases in paragraphs B.3 through B.6, are measured from the time \nthe use became a conditional use or the last conditional use review of the use, whichever is \nmost recent, to the present. \n1. When proposed alterations to the site will not violate any conditions of approval; \n2. When there will be a net loss in site area; \n3. When there will be an increase or decrease in the net number of parking spaces by up \nto 2 spaces or up to 10 percent of the total number of parking spaces, whichever  \nis greater; \n4. When the alterations will not increase the net building area on the site by more than \n25 percent, up to a maximum of 25,000 square feet; \n5. When the alterations will not increase the exterior improvement area on the site by \nmore than 25 percent, up to a maximum of 25,000 square feet. Parking area increases \nthat are allowed by B.3 are exempt from this limitation; or \n6. When the alterations will not increase the net building area and the exterior \nimprovement area on the site by more than 25 percent, up to a maximum of 25,000 \nsquare feet. Parking area increases that are allowed by B.3 are exempt from this \nlimitation.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.281 \n6/30/23  Schools and School Sites \n \n281-5 \nC. Type III. All other alterations to development on the site, including alterations not allowed \nby Subsections A. and B. are reviewed through a Type III procedure.  \n33.281.055 Loss of Conditional Use Status on School Sites.  \nIf a school use is discontinued for more than 5 continuous years, a new conditional use is required. A \nschool use has been discontinued if the use ceases operations, even if the structure or materials \nrelated to the use remain. Any school use proposing to locate at the site after more than 5 years of \ndiscontinued use must go through a new conditional use review. The new conditional use is \nreviewed as follows: \nA. If the school use has been discontinued for less than 10 years, and the proposed new \nschool use does not include any of the Type III changes listed in 33.281.030.B or \n33.281.050.C, the conditional use is reviewed through a Type II procedure. \nB. If the school use has been discontinued for less than 10 years, and the proposed new \nschool use includes any of the Type III changes listed in 33.281.030.B or 33.281.050.C, the \nconditional use is reviewed through a Type III procedure. \nC. If the school use has been discontinued for more than 10 years, the conditional use is \nreviewed through a Type III procedure. \nRegulations in C and E zones \n33.281.060 Use Regulations \nIn the C and E zones, new schools and changes to existing schools are allowed by right subject to the \ndevelopment standards of the base zone and this chapter. Other uses on school sites are subject to \nthe regulations of the base zone. \nDevelopment Standards \n33.281.100 General Standards \nIn the OS, R, and IR zones, the development standards for institutional uses apply except where \nsuperseded by the standards in this chapter. The institutional development standards are stated in \n33.110.270 and 33.120.275. In C and E zones, the development standards of the base zone apply \nexcept where superseded by the standards in this chapter. Recreational fields used for organized \nsports are subject to Chapter 33.279, Recreational Fields for Organized Sports.  \n33.281.110 Building Coverage and Floor Area Ratio \nIf the school site is contiguous with a public park, and the school has a signed joint use agreement \nwith the Park Bureau, then the building coverage and FAR calculations are based on the combined \nsite area. \n33.281.120 Special Event Parking \nPaved play areas may be used for special event parking. The area does not have to comply with \nlandscaping requirements for parking areas. These areas may not be used for accessory parking for \nthe uses on the site.  Chapter 33.281  Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSchools and School Sites  6/30/23 \n281-6 \n33.281.130 Bus Loading \nA. Purpose. The purpose of bus loading requirements is to provide safe and efficient bus \nloading areas in a manner that has minimal negative impacts on the surrounding uses and \non the traffic flow and access potential of the surrounding streets. Whenever possible bus \nloading should be done on-site. \nB. New school sites. On-site bus loading is required for new school sites.  \n1. When there is a conditional use review, the size and design of the bus loading area is \ndetermined as part of the conditional use review.  \n2. When there is no conditional use review, the bus loading area must meet the \nstandards of Section 33.266.310, Loading Standards, except for landscaped setbacks. \nBus loading areas are required to comply with the landscaped setbacks for parking \nareas, not loading areas. \nC. Existing school sites.  \n1. When there is a conditional use review, alterations to on-street and on-site bus \nloading are reviewed by PP&D and Bureau of Transportation. The provision of on-site \nbus loading is encouraged whenever possible. \n2. When alterations to bus loading are not part of a conditional use review, alterations to \nexisting on-street bus loading are reviewed and approved by the Portland Bureau of \nTransportation. \n33.281.140 Landscaping \nThis section states exceptions to the normal landscaping requirements. \nA. Parking areas. In parking areas where L3 landscaping is normally required, a 20-foot deep \narea landscaped to the L2 standard may be substituted. Special event parking is addressed \nin 33.281.120. \nB. Other landscaping. In situations where L3 landscaping is required by the base zone or other \nregulations, L1 or L2 landscaping may be substituted. However, the landscaping \nrequirements for parking areas are stated in Subsection A. above. \n33.281.150 Temporary Structures \nTemporary, portable, or relocatable structures are treated as any other type of structure. Structures \nwhich are proposed to be placed temporarily on a site during construction, are reviewed as part of \nthe conditional use review of the proposed construction. \n \n(Amended by: Ord.

Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.284 \n10/1/24 Self-Service Storage \n \n284-1 \n33.284 Self-Service Storage \n284 \n \nSections: \n33.284.010 Purpose \n33.284.020 Use Regulations \n33.284.030 Development Standards \n33.284.040 Design Review \n33.284.010 Purpose \nSelf-Service Storage uses have some characteristics in common with both commercial use and industrial \nuses. This chapter provides regulations so that Self-Service Storage uses can be appropriately sited in \neither industrial zones or some commercial/mixed use zones, while maintaining the desired character \nand function of the specific zones. In general, Self-Service Storage uses are similar to other commercial \nuses in that they provide a service to residential and business uses. The character of their development \nis often more similar to industrial buildings. The supplemental use and design standards ensure that \ndevelopment of self-service storage facilities add to the vitality of commercial areas and transit-oriented \nlocations. \n33.284.020 Use Regulations \nA. Prohibited Use. Outside of the Central City Plan District, Self-Service Storage is prohibited on a \nsite where any portion of the site is within 500 feet of a transit station.  \nB. Required Ground Floor Active Use. The following ground floor active use regulations apply \noutside of the Central City Plan District in the CM3, CE, CX, EG1, EG2 and EX zones on the \nfollowing sites: \n1.  When ground floor active use is required. The ground floor active use standard applies \nwhen a site with a Self-Service Storage use has frontage on a neighborhood corridor, civic \ncorridor or streetcar line. \n2. Ground floor active use standard. At least 50 percent of the ground-level floor area \nlocated within 100 feet of a neighborhood corridor, civic corridor or streetcar line must be \nin one or more of the ground floor active uses listed in Paragraph B.3, where allowed by \nthe base zone. Parking areas do not count toward the required amount of ground floor \nactive use. Areas shared among the active uses listed below are included in active floor \narea. Areas shared by a use not listed below are not included in active floor area. \n3. Ground floor active uses: \na. Retail Sales and Service;  \nb. Office; \nc. Vehicle Repair; \nd. Industrial Service; \ne. Manufacturing and Production; \nf. Wholesale Sales;  Chapter 33.284 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSelf-Service Storage 10/1/24 \n \n284-2 \ng. Daycare; \nh. Community Service;  \ni. Religious Institutions. \n33.284.030 Development Standards \nThe development standards of the base zone apply unless the standard is superseded by regulations in \nthis section. \nA. Purpose. The special development standards in the C and EX zones are intended to allow self-\nservice storage facilities to locate on certain sites in these zones where they can be close to the \nresidential and business uses that they serve. At the same time, the development standards \ndirect their location to sites that do not have major frontage on commercial streets. This \nprevents large sections of the commercial streets from being developed with uses that have \nextremely low activity levels that detract from the vitality and desired interaction among \ncommercial uses in the area. This also allows them to locate on odd-shaped or infill sites that \nare difficult to develop for many commercial uses. \nB. Maximum site frontage. In the C and EX zones, the maximum site frontage along a street is 100 \nfeet. This limitation applies only to sites for the construction of new buildings that are 30 feet \nor less in height. \nC. Storage areas. The maximum size of individual storage areas in C and EX zones is 500  \nsquare feet. \nD. Internal circulation. The internal circulation between buildings must be wide enough so that \nthere is a 12-foot wide travel lane for emergency vehicles to pass while tenant’s vehicles are \nparked at their storage areas. \nE.

Temporary uses have no inherent \nrights within the zone in which they locate. \n33.296.020 Description \nTemporary activities are characterized by their short term or seasonal nature and by the fact that \npermanent improvements are not made to the site. Temporary activities include: construction \nstaging, garage sales, temporary carnivals and fairs, parking lot sales, retail warehouse sales, and \nseasonal sales such as Christmas tree sales. Temporary activities that meet the regulations described \nin this chapter are not considered primary or accessory uses. There are two categories of temporary \nactivities. First, there are those which are allowed by the zone but do not meet the development \nstandards. Examples include Christmas tree sales and a parking lot sale in a commercial zone. \nSecond, there are temporary activities which if permanent, would not be allowed by the base zone. \nExamples include church carnivals in residential zones and retail warehouse sales in industrial zones. \n33.296.030 Temporary Activities Allowed \nA. Residential sales offices. Sales offices for major subdivisions or planned unit developments \nare allowed in the IR, CI2, and RF through RM4 and RMP zones. Sales offices are allowed at \nthe development site until all lots or houses are sold or for 10 years after the final plat is \napproved, whichever is less. Use of the sales office for sites outside of the project  \nis prohibited. \nB. Show of model homes. The viewing of model homes within a subdivision for a fee is \nallowed in the IR, CI2, and RF through RM4 and RMP zones for a period not to exceed one \nmonth. Only one showing is allowed per phase of a subdivision. \nC. Incidental Sales. Incidental sales of items are allowed based on the zone in which the site is \nlocated:  \n1.  Garage sales. Garage sales and other sales of items from the site may occur in the IR, \nCI1, and RF through RM4 and RMP zones for no more than 3 consecutive days on 2 \ndifferent occasions during a calendar year.

In Residential zones, the maximum rotor swept area is 50 square feet. In commercial/mixed \nuse, and campus institutional zones, the maximum rotor swept area is 150 square feet. There is no \nmaximum in the E and I zones.  \n33.299.120 Setbacks and Height \nThe height of a turbine is measured to the tip of the rotor blade at its highest point. For pole \nmounted turbines, height is measured from grade at the base of the pole. For building mounted \nturbines, height is measured from the base point of the building. \nA. View Corridors. Although the regulations of this section allow wind turbines to exceed the \nheight limits of the base zones, they are not allowed to extend into a view corridor \ndesignated by the Scenic Resources Protection Plan (1991) or the Central City Scenic \nResources Protection Plan (2018). \nB. Pole Mounted. Pole mounted turbines must meet the following. Distances between lot \nlines and the pole and turbine are measured at the closest points: \n1. Front and street setback. The pole and turbine are not allowed in a required front or \nstreet setback; \n2. Setback from all lot lines. The pole and turbine must be set back at least 10 feet from \nall lot lines;   Chapter 33.299 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nWind Turbines 8/10/20 \n \n299-2 \n3. Height. The pole and turbine are subject to the base zone height limit. However, for \nevery foot that the pole and turbine are set back farther than specified in B.1 and 2, \nthe height of the turbine may increase one additional foot above the base zone height \nlimit. Each additional foot of height is earned when the pole and turbine are set back \nfrom all property lines by an additional foot. The height may not increase more than \n50 percent above the base zone height limit. See Figure 299-1. \nFigure 299-1 \nPole-Mounted Wind Turbine \n \nC. Building mounted.  \n1. Setbacks. Building mounted turbines are subject to the minimum building setbacks of \nthe building they are mounted on.  \n2. Height. A turbine may be up to 50 percent above the base zone height limit, or 45 feet \nabove the height of the building it is mounted on, whichever is less. See Figure 299-2.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.299 \n8/10/20 Wind Turbines \n \n299-3 \nFigure 299-2 \nBuilding-Mounted Wind Turbine \n \nD.  Exceptions.  \n1. RF zone. Turbines in the RF zone are subject to Subsections A and B. However, there is \nno height limit if the turbine is set back from all lot lines a distance equal to its height.  \n2. EG2, IG, and IH zones. In the EG2, IG, and IH zones, there is no setback or height limit \nexcept where lot lines abut R-zoned sites. Where the lot lines abut R-zoned sites: \na. Pole-mounted turbines are subject to the following:  \n(1) Setback. They must be set back at least 10 feet from lot lines that abut R-\nzoned sites.  \n(2) Height. They are subject to the height regulations for pole-mounted \nturbines that apply to the adjacent R-zone. If the site abuts more than one \nR-zone, the most restrictive height regulation applies.  \n For every foot that the pole and turbine are set back farther than 10 feet \nfrom the adjacent R zone, the height of the turbine may increase one \nadditional foot above the adjacent R-zone base zone height limit. Using this \nprovision, the height may not increase more than 50 percent above the \nadjacent R-zone base zone height limit. \n However, there is no height limit if the turbine is set back from all lot lines a \ndistance equal to its height.  \n \n \nb. Building-mounted turbines. Building-mounted turbines must meet the setbacks \nand height regulations that apply to building-mounted turbines in the adjacent R- Chapter 33.299 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nWind Turbines 8/10/20 \n \n299-4 \nzone. If the site abuts more than one R-zone, the most restrictive  \nregulations apply.  \n33.299.130 Noise. \nIn residential zones, turbines must have an AWEA-rated sound level of 45dBA or less. The City noise \nstandards of Title 18 also apply in all zones. \n \n(Added by Ord. No. 183598, effective 4/24/10; Amended by: Ord. No. 188177, effective 5/24/18; \nOrd.

The separation is achieved by restricting motor vehicle access, increasing \nsetbacks, requiring additional landscaping, restricting signs, and in some cases by requiring \nadditional information and proof of mitigation for uses that may cause off-site impacts  \nand nuisances. \n33.410.020 Map Symbol \nThe Buffer zone is shown on the Official Zoning Maps with a letter \"b\" map symbol. \n33.410.030 Applying the Buffer Zone \nThe Buffer zone is to be applied primarily along the edge of a nonresidential zone abutting or \nlocated across a street from a residential zone. For industrial and employment zones, the street can \nbe any classification of street, as classified by the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive \nPlan. For commercial zones, the street should be a Local Service Traffic Street. \n33.410.040 Development Standards \nThe following standards must be met in the Buffer Overlay zone.  \nA. Setbacks and landscaping.  \n1. C-zones.  In the C zones, a 10-foot setback landscaped to at least the L3 standard is \nrequired along all lot lines that: \na. Are across a local service street or alley from R-zoned land; or \nb. Abut the rear lot line of an R-zoned lot. See Figure 410-1. \n2. E and I zones. In the E and I zones, a 20 foot setback landscaped to at least the L3 \nstandard is required along all lots lines within the Buffer Overlay Zone that abut or are \nacross the street from a residential zone. The setback must be landscaped to at least \nthe L3 standard. The setback may be reduced to 10 feet if the setback is landscaped to \nat least the L4 standard. See Figure 410-2. \n \n  Chapter 33.410  Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nBuffer Zone  3/1/25 \n \n410-2 \n3. Exceptions for sites entirely in residential uses: \na. Landscaping. The landscape requirements of this subsection do not apply. \nHowever, landscaping requirements of the base zone, other overlay zone, and \nplan district must be met. \nb. Fences. Fences up to 3-1/2 feet high are allowed in the buffer setback abutting a \nstreet lot line, and up to 8 feet high in other buffer setback areas. \nB. Structures and exterior activities. \n1. Structures, exterior storage, and exterior display are prohibited in the setbacks \nrequired by Subsection A.  \n2. Exterior work activities are prohibited in the Buffer Overlay Zone. \nC. Access. \n1. Generally. Except as specified in Paragraphs C.2 and C.3, access through the setbacks \nrequired by Subsection A is prohibited. \n2. Pedestrian and bicycle access. Pedestrian and bicycle access is allowed through the \nsetbacks, but may not be more than 6 feet wide. \n3. Vehicle access for residential. Sites where any of the floor area is in Residential uses \nmay have vehicle access through the setbacks. The width of the access may be a \nmaximum of 20 percent of the site frontage or 20 feet, whichever is less. As an \nexception, a vehicle access at least 9 feet wide is allowed. The vehicle access may \nserve only the residential uses; access through the setbacks to vehicle areas serving \nnon-residential uses on the site is prohibited. \nD.

The environmental regulations encourage flexibility and \ninnovation in site planning and provide for development that is carefully designed to be sensitive to \nthe site's protected resources. These regulations also help meet other City goals, along with other \nregional, state, and federal goals and regulations. The environmental regulations also carry out \nComprehensive Plan policies and objectives. \n33.430.015 Purpose of the Environmental Protection Zone \nThe Environmental Protection zone provides the highest level of protection to the most important \nresources and functional values. These resources and functional values are identified and assigned \nvalue in the inventory and economic, social, environmental, and energy (ESEE) analysis for each \nspecific study area. Development will be approved in the environmental protection zone only in rare \nand unusual circumstances.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.430 \n3/1/24 Environmental Zones \n \n430-3 \n33.430.017 Purpose of the Environmental Conservation Zone \nThe Environmental Conservation zone conserves important resources and functional values in areas \nwhere the resources and functional values can be protected while allowing environmentally \nsensitive urban development. \n33.430.020 Environmental Reports \nThe application of the environmental zones is based on detailed studies that have been carried out \nwithin six separate areas of the City. The City’s policy objectives for these study areas are described \nin reports. Each study identifies the natural resource features and describes the functional values \nwithin resource sites. Functional values are the benefits provided by resources. The values for each \nresource site are described in the inventory section of these reports. The City has adopted the \nfollowing six environmental study reports: \n• Environmental Overlay Zone Map Correction Project \n• Columbia Corridor Industrial and Environmental Mapping Project \n• East Buttes, Terraces and Wetlands Conservation Plan \n• Johnson Creek Basin Protection Plan \n• Northwest Hills Natural Areas Protection Plan \n• Middle Columbia Corridor/Airport Economic, Social, Environmental and Energy (ESEE) \nAnalysis \n33.430.030 Relationship To Other Environmental Regulations \nSome of the six study areas discussed under Section 33.430.020 impose additional environmental \nregulations in Plan Districts. These additional regulations either supplement or supersede the \nregulations of this Chapter. Paragraph 33.700.070.E describes the hierarchy of regulations within the \nZoning Code. \nAdditionally, Natural Resource Management Plans may contain regulations that supersede or \nsupplement the regulations of this chapter. Whenever natural resource management plan \nprovisions conflict with other provisions of this chapter, the natural resource management plan \nprovisions supersede. Non-conflicting provisions supplement the provisions of this chapter. Maps \n430-6, 7, and 8 show Natural Resource Management Plan areas. \nThe following Plan Districts and Natural Resource Management Plans have additional regulations \nthat may supersede or supplement the environmental regulations of Chapter 430: \n• The Balch Creek Watershed (see Chapter 33.563, Northwest Hills Plan District) \n• Cascade Station / Portland International Center Plan District (see Chapter 33.508, Cascade \nStation / Portland International Center [CS/PIC]) \n• The Columbia South Shore within the Columbia Corridor (see Chapter 33.515, Columbia \nSouth Shore Plan District) \n• Johnson Creek Basin (see Chapter 33.537, Johnson Creek Basin Plan District) \n• Northwest Hills Natural Areas (see Chapter 33.563, Northwest Hills Plan District) \n• Skyline West Conservation Plan area (see Chapter 33.563, Northwest Hills Plan District) \n• East Columbia Neighborhood Natural Resources Management Plan (separate document) \n• Forest Park Natural Resources Management Plan (separate document) \n• Natural Resources Management Plan for the Peninsula Drainage District No. 1 \n(separate document) \n• Portland International Airport Plan District (see Chapter 33.565, Portland International \nAirport Plan District)  Chapter 33.430 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nEnvironmental Zones 3/1/24 \n \n430-4 \nThis chapter contains only the City's environmental regulations. Activities which the City regulates \nthrough this chapter may also be regulated by other agencies. In cases of overlapping City, Special \nDistrict, Regional, State, or Federal regulations, the more stringent regulations will control. City \napproval does not imply approval by other agencies. \n33.430.033 Relationship to Scenic Resources  \nWhen an environmental zone has been applied at the location of a designated scenic resource, \nenvironmental review must include consideration of the scenic qualities of the resource as identified \nin the Scenic Resources Protection Plan, Central City Scenic Resources Protection Plan, or River Plan / \nSouth Reach Scenic Resources Protection Plan, and any relevant development standards of 33.480.  \n33.430.035 Other City Regulations \nOther City regulations such as Title 10, Erosion Control, and Title 11, Trees, may apply to sites in the \nenvironmental overlay zones. \n33.430.040 Overlay Zones and Map Symbols \nThere are two environmental overlay zones. \nA. The Environmental Protection overlay zone is applied wherever the City determines that \nhighly significant resources and functional values are present. The Environmental \nProtection overlay zone is shown on the Official Zoning Maps with either the \"p\" symbol or \na dark green color. \nB. The Environmental Conservation overlay zone is applied wherever the City determines that \nsignificant resources and functional values are present. The Environmental Conservation \noverlay zone is shown on the Official Zoning Maps with either the \"c\" symbol or a light \ngreen color. \n33.430.050 Subareas of Environmental Zones \nEnvironmental overlay zones contain resource areas and transition areas. Resource areas contain \nsignificant resources and functional values. Transition areas surround the resource areas. Resources \nand functional values within transition areas are not significant, but they provide a buffer for the \nsignificant resources and functional values within the resource area. The transition area is measured \nas the first 25 feet inward from an environmental zone boundary. The remaining area is the \nresource area. See Figure 430-1. The following are three exceptions: \nA. Where part of an environmental zone boundary is also the City Limits or Urban Service \nBoundary, there is no transition area. \nB. Where environmental zone boundaries are contained within other environmental zone \nboundaries, there is no transition area. \nC. Where environmental zone boundaries abut other environmental zone boundaries, \ntransition areas are only measured from the combined outer-most boundaries of the \nenvironmental zones.

Encourage sensitive development while minimizing impact on resources; \nB. Provide clear limitations on disturbance within resource areas; \nC. Ensure that new development and alterations to existing development are compatible with \nand preserve the resources and functional values protected by the  \nenvironmental zones; \nD. Provide clear planting and erosion control requirements within resource areas;  \nE. Buffer the resource area from the noise, fumes, lights, and motion of vehicular traffic \nassociated with industrial, commercial, and multi-dwelling residential uses; and  Chapter 33.430 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nEnvironmental Zones 3/1/24 \n \n430-12 \nF. Limit the impacts on resources and functional values resulting from construction of certain \ntypes of utilities. \n33.430.120 Procedure \nA. Generally. Compliance with the development standards of this chapter is required for all \ndevelopment in the environmental zones and is determined as part of the building permit \nor development permit application process.  For proposals that cannot meet all of the \nstandards, Environmental Review is required.  Where a proposal can meet all the \nstandards, the applicant may choose to go through the discretionary environmental review \nprocess, or to meet the objective standards of this chapter. \n \nThe development standards are Sections 33.430.140 through .195; Sections 33.430.150 \nthrough .195 address specific types or aspects of development, while 33.430.140 applies to \nproposals not covered by the more specific sections.  A proposal may be subject to several \nsections.  For example, construction of a house may be subject to the General \nDevelopment Standards of 33.430.140, the standards of 33.430.150, Utilities, and the \nstandards of 33.430.180, Stormwater Outfalls.  If the proposal can meet the general \nstandards and standards for utilities, but not those for a stormwater outfall, environmental \nreview is required only for the stormwater outfall.  To be eligible to use the development \nstandards for an aspect of a proposal, all of the standards within the relevant section must \nbe met. \nB. Adjustments prohibited. Adjustments to these standards are prohibited. Proposals that do \nnot meet all the standards within each relevant section require approval through \nenvironmental review described in Sections 33.430.210 through .280. \n33.430.130 Permit Application Requirements \nA building permit or development permit application that is reviewed for compliance with the \nstandards of this chapter requires more information than a permit not affected by these provisions. \nThe information in Subsections A and B must be submitted with permit application plans. \nSubmission of the information in Subsection C is optional. \nA. An existing conditions site plan including: \n1. Location of all Environmental Zone lines on the site; \n2. Outline of any existing disturbance area, including existing utility locations; \n3. Location of any wetlands or water bodies on the site or within 50 feet of the site. \nIndicate the location of the top of bank, centerline of stream, or wetland boundary  \nas appropriate; \n4. Within the disturbance area, all trees that are 6 or more inches in diameter must be \nindicated by size and species. Trees outside of the disturbance area must be shown as \ncrown cover with an indication of species composition;  \n5. Topography shown by contour lines at 2 foot vertical contours in areas of slopes less \nthan 10 percent and at 5 foot vertical contours in areas of slopes 10 percent  \nor greater; and \n6.

Except as specified in \n33.610.200 and 33.611.200, the review body may not consider modifications to standards for which \nadjustments are prohibited. Modifications are done as part of the environmental review process and \nare not required to go through the adjustment process. Adjustments to use-related development \nstandards (such as floor-area ratios, intensity of use, size of the use, number of units, or \nconcentration of uses) are subject to the adjustment process of Chapter 33.805. In order to approve \nthese modifications, the review body must find that the development will result in greater \nprotection of the resources and functional values identified on the site and will, on balance, be \nconsistent with the purpose of the applicable regulations. For modifications to lot dimension \nstandards, the review body must also find that the development will not significantly detract from \nthe livability or appearance of the area. \nNatural Resource Management Plans \n33.430.310 Purpose \nNatural resource management plans provide an alternative to case-by-case environmental reviews. \nThese plans provide the means to evaluate the cumulative effects of development and mitigation \nproposed at different times and in different places within the same large ecosystem. These plans are \nof particular value in areas of multiple ownership. These plans also provide opportunities for \ncoordination with, or joint adoption by, other local governments; special districts; and regional \nstate, and federal agencies. \n33.430.320 Scope \nNatural resource management plans must cover large ecosystems such as a forests, creeks, sloughs, \nor watersheds. These plans must address all resources and functional values conserved and  Chapter 33.430 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nEnvironmental Zones 3/1/24 \n \n430-40 \nprotected by environmental zones within the plan boundaries. The plan must also address all \nsignificant detrimental impacts of uses allowed by the plan. \n33.430.330 Procedure \nAdoption and amendment of natural resource management plans is a legislative procedure. \nWhenever natural resource management plan provisions conflict with other provisions of this \nchapter, the natural resource management plan provisions supersede. Non-conflicting provisions \nsupplement the provisions of this chapter. \n33.430.340 Components \nThe applicant must submit a natural resource management plan with the following components: \nA. Management objectives to maintain or enhance resources and functional values; \nB. Lists of allowed and prohibited uses; \nC. Maps of areas where these uses are allowed and prohibited; \nD. Types of mitigation or enhancement required; \nE. Maps of areas reserved for these mitigation or enhancement actions; \nF. Timetables for development, mitigation, and enhancement; and \nG. Procedures and criteria for approving uses. \n33.430.350 Approval Criteria for Adoption and Amendment. \nA natural resource management plan, or an amendment to a natural resource management plan, \nwill be approved if it meets the following approval criteria: \nA. Compliance with Sections 33.430.310 through 350; \nB. Compliance with Statewide Planning Goals and the Portland Comprehensive Plan; and \nC. If the natural resource management plan is approved as part of a plan district, the criteria \nfor adoption of plan districts that are in Section 33.500.050 are met. \nCorrections to Violations of This Chapter \n33.430.400 Purpose \nThe purpose of Sections 33.430.400 and .405 is to ensure the timely restoration and remediation of \nnatural resources and functional values that have been degraded due to a violation of this chapter. \nThese sections establish a process to determine which review requirements will be applied to \nremedy a violation that takes place in the environmental overlay zone. The type of review required \ndepends on the circumstances of the violation. Section 33.430.405 details methods for correcting \nsuch violations and Title 3 of the City Code details the enforcement penalties. \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.430 \n3/1/24 Environmental Zones \n \n430-41 \n33.430.405 Correction Options \nApplicants must choose one of the following options to correct environmental code violations. \nA.

Future urban areas are, (1) \nall areas beyond Metro’s Urban Growth Boundary (UGB), and (2) areas within the UGB to which the \nextension of full urban services would not be cost effective or would cause unacceptable harm to the \nenvironment. The Future Urban overlay zone limits development by prohibiting the creation of new \nlots with a total area of less than 20 acres. \n33.435.020 Map Symbol \nThe Future Urban zone is shown on the Official Zoning Maps with an \"f\" map symbol (for future). \n33.435.030 Applying and Removing the Zone \nThe Future Urban zone must be applied to all lands designated \"Natural Resource\" on the Metro \nRegional Land Use Framework Map. When the UGB is expanded to include Future Urban-zoned land, \nthe Future Urban zone is to be removed from that land following the zoning map amendment \nprocedures in 33.855.080. \n33.435.040 Minimum Lot Area \nThe minimum lot area for the creation of new lots in the Future Urban zone is 20 acres. The creation \nof new lots of less than 20 acres is prohibited. Existing lots of less than 20 acres may be developed, \nbut may not be reduced in area. \n \n(Added by: Ord.

Purpose. The purpose of the greenway overlay zones is to implement the land use pattern \nidentified in the Willamette Greenway Plan and the water quality requirements of Metro \nCode 3.07.340.B (Title 3). There are five greenway overlay zones, each with its own focus \nand purpose. The purpose of each of the overlay zones is stated below. \n1. River Natural. The River Natural zone protects, conserves, and enhances land of scenic \nquality or of significant importance as wildlife habitat. \n2. River Recreational. The River Recreational zone encourages river-dependent and river-\nrelated recreational uses which provide a variety of types of public access to, along \nand in the river, and which enhance the river's natural and scenic qualities. \n3. River General. The River General zone allows for uses and development which are \nconsistent with the base zoning, which allow for public use and enjoyment of the \nriverfront, and which enhance the river's natural and scenic qualities. \n4. River Industrial. The River Industrial zone encourages and promotes the development \nof river-dependent and river-related industries which strengthen the economic \nviability of Portland as a marine shipping and industrial harbor, while preserving and \nenhancing the riparian habitat and providing public access where practical. \n5. River Water Quality. The River Water Quality zone is designed to protect the \nfunctional values of water quality resources by limiting or mitigating the impact of \ndevelopment in the setback. \nB. Where these regulations apply.  \n1. General. The regulations of this chapter apply to all land and fills and structures in \nwater within the North reach and industrially zoned sites within the Central reach of \nthe Willamette Greenway. The North reach and industrially zoned sites within the \nCentral reach of the Willamette Greenway are shown on Map 440-1, and are \ndesignated on the Official Zoning Maps with River Natural, River Recreational, River \nGeneral, River Industrial, or River Water Quality overlay zones. \n2. Exceptions. The major public trail standards of Section 33.440.240 apply to all lands \nwithin the Willamette Greenway Plan boundary designated with the major public trail \nsymbol but which are outside of the greenway zones.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.440 \n10/1/24 Greenway Overlay Zones \n \n440-3 \nC. Removal or remediation of hazardous substances. For projects limited to the removal or \nremediation of hazardous substances conducted under ORS 465.200 through 465.510 and \n465.900, the regulations of this chapter apply only to the portion of the site located within \nthe boundaries of the removal or remedial action areas, as delineated by the Department \nof Environmental Quality. \nD. Map symbols. The greenway overlay zones are shown on the Official Zoning Maps with the \nfollowing map symbols: \nOverlay Zone Map Symbol \nRiver Natural n \nRiver Recreational r \nRiver General g \nRiver Industrial i \nRiver Water quality q \n33.440.050 Relationship to State and Federal Reviews \nIn addition to any City requirements, development within or riverward of the greenway setback, \nincluding fills, may be regulated by the Oregon Division of State Lands and the U.S. Army Corp of \nEngineers. City approval does not imply approval by these agencies. \n33.440.060 Sunset Provision \nThe River Water Quality Overlay Zone will be deleted from the Zoning Code when revised \nWillamette River Greenway regulations are adopted. \nUse Regulations \n33.440.100 Use-Related Restrictions \nA. Generally. In most cases, the greenway zones do not restrict primary uses that are allowed \nin the base zones by right, with limitations, or as a conditional use. Exceptions to this are in \nthe River Recreational, River Industrial, and River Water Quality zones. The restrictions on \nuses are stated in Subsection B. below. The location of development for an allowed use is \nregulated by the development standards below. Any changes to the land associated with \nthe use are subject to greenway review unless exempted. See 33.440.310 and  \n33.440.320 below. \nB. Use restrictions. \n1. River Recreational zone. Primary uses in the River Recreational zone are limited to \nrecreational uses which are river-dependent or river-related. \n2. River Industrial zone.  \na. In the River Industrial zone, river-dependent and river-related primary uses are \nallowed by right on sites that front the river.  \nb. Primary uses that are not river-dependent or river-related are allowed by right \non sites that front the river when: \n(1) The non-river-dependent or non-river-related use is located entirely on lots \nwithin the site that do not have river frontage;   Chapter 33.440 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGreenway Overlay Zones 10/1/24 \n \n440-4 \n(2) The site is owned by a public agency; and \n(3) The site is shown on Map 440-2. \nc. Primary uses that are not river-dependent or river-related may be allowed \non sites that front the river if they are approved through greenway review. \nThey must comply with the approval criteria of 33.440.350.B. below.  \nd. There are no special use restrictions on sites that do not have river frontage. \n3. River Natural and River General zones. There are no special use restrictions in the \nRiver Natural and River General zones. \n4. River Water Quality zone. There are no special use restrictions associated specifically \nwith the River Water Quality zone. However, any use restrictions that apply as a result \nof an accompanying Greenway Overlay Zone also apply within the River Water Quality \nzone. \nDevelopment Standards \n33.440.200 Application of the Development Standards \nAny changes to land or development within the greenway zones, including rights-of-way, are subject \nto the development standards of this chapter. \n33.440.210 Development in the Greenway Setback \nA. General. The requirements of this section focus on whether the development is river-\ndependent or river-related. The focus is not on the primary use of the land. For example, a \nmarine freight terminal is a river-dependent primary use, but not all development \nassociated with the terminal is river-dependent. The dock and loading cranes are river \ndependent, but the parking lot, storage areas, and corporate offices are not. Another \nexample is a multi-dwelling complex. The residential units are not a river-dependent or \nriver-related primary use. A boat dock for the residents is river-dependent, but parking and \nstorage areas are not. \nB. The setback areas.  \n1. Generally. The greenway setback extends from the top of the bank to a point 25 feet \nlandward of the top of the bank, except in the River Water Quality overlay zone. See \nFigure 440-1.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.440 \n10/1/24 Greenway Overlay Zones \n \n440-5 \nFigure 440-1 \nGreenway Setback \n \n2. River Water Quality overlay zone. The greenway setback in the River Water Quality \nzone extends from the top of the bank to a point 50 feet landward of the top of the \nbank for sites with less than 25 percent slope, or to a point 200 feet landward for sites \nwith 25 percent or greater slope. See Figure 440-2 and Table 440-1. \n3. Wetlands in the River Water Quality overlay zone. The greenway setback is 50 feet \naround the delineated edge of the wetland in addition to the setback from the top of \nthe bank. \nFigure 440-2 \nGreenway Setback in the River Water Quality Zone \n \n \nTable 440-1 \nSetbacks for River Water Quality Zone \nSlope Landward of Top of Bank Width of Vegetated Corridor [1] \n< 25% 50 feet \n> 25% for 150 feet or more [2] 200 feet \n[1] To establish the width of the vegetated corridor, slope is measured in 25 -foot increments  \nlandward of top of bank until slope is less than 25% \n[2] Vegetated corridors in excess of 50 feet apply on steep slopes only in the uphill direction \nfrom the protected water feature.  Chapter 33.440 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGreenway Overlay Zones 10/1/24 \n \n440-6 \nC. Development regulations.  \n1. Development landward of the greenway setback. Development, exterior alterations, \nexcavations, and fills landward of the greenway setback are not required to be river-\ndependent or river-related and are subject to greenway review, unless exempt under \nSection 33.440.320, Exemptions. \n2. Development within the greenway setback.  \na. River-dependent and river-related development. Development, exterior \nalterations, excavations, fills, and associated tree removal within the greenway \nsetback that are river-dependent or river-related may be allowed if approved \nthrough greenway review, unless exempt under Section 33.440.320, Exemptions.  \nb.  Development that is not river-dependent or river-related. \n(1) General. Development, exterior alterations, excavations, or fills that are not \nriver-dependent or river-related require greenway review and a Greenway \nGoal Exception to locate in the greenway setback. \n(2) Exception. Within the River Water Quality zone, development, exterior \nalterations, excavations, and fills that are not river-dependent or river-\nrelated do not require a Greenway Goal Exception when located outside of \nthe area that is within the first 25 feet landward of the top of bank. See \nFigure 440-3. \n3. Development riverward of the greenway setback. Development, exterior alterations, \nexcavations, fills, and associated tree removal riverward of the greenway setback that \nare river-dependent or river-related may be allowed if approved through greenway \nreview, unless exempt under Section 33.440.320, Exemptions. Development, exterior \nalterations, excavations, or fills that are not river-dependent or river-related require \ngreenway review and a Greenway Goal Exception to locate riverward of the greenway \nsetback. \nFigure 440-3 \nGreenway Goal Exception in the River Water Quality Zone \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.440 \n10/1/24 Greenway Overlay Zones \n \n440-7 \n33.440.220 Floor Area Ratios \nThe maximum floor area ratio (FAR) is 2 to 1 for the first 200 feet inland measured from the ordinary \nhigh water line, except in any of the following situations: \nA. The site is already subject to a more restrictive FAR; or \nB. The use is an industrial use in an IH or IG base zone. \n33.440.230 Landscaping \nA. Required landscaping. Landscaping must be provided to conserve or re-establish \nvegetative cover within or riverward of the greenway setback. The landscaping must \ncomply with the standards specified below. This is in addition to any landscape \nrequirements of other chapters of this Title. The greenway landscape requirements may be \nincluded in any overall percentage-of-site landscape requirements of the base zone. \nLandscaping is not required where it would significantly interfere with a river-dependent or \nriver-related use or development, or where the Fire Marshal finds that it would pose a \nsafety hazard. \nB. Landscaping standards. Required greenway landscaping must comply with the standards \nstated below. \n1. A minimum of one tree for every 20 feet of river frontage. \n2. A minimum of one shrub for every two feet of river frontage. However, if the \ngreenway trail is proposed to be wider than 12 feet, the shrub calculations will be \nbased on a minimum of one shrub per 25 square feet of area within and riverward of \nthe greenway setback that is not paved or reveted. Areas of high human use which \nprovide public access to the river, such as a beach, are exempt from the  \nshrub calculations. \n3. Remaining areas which are not paved or reveted surfaces must have living  \nground cover. \n4. All trees and shrubs are to be planted generally within and riverward of the  \ngreenway setback. \n5. The standards are for calculation purposes only, and do not require or imply linear \nplanting. Grouping of trees and shrubs is encouraged, particularly on the riverbank. \nC. Native plants. All landscaping must comply with the native plant requirement of the \nWillamette Greenway Plan. \nD. Exception for sites with an existing nonconforming use, allowed use, limited use, or \nconditional use. The regulations of this subsection apply to sites with an existing \nnonconforming use, an allowed use, a limited use, or a conditional use. When alterations \nare made to a site that does not meet the standards of this section, and the alterations are \nover the threshold of Paragraph D.1, below, the site must be brought into conformance \nwith the development standards listed in Subsections A, B, and C, above. The value of the \nalterations is based on the entire project, not individual building permits. The cost of the \nupgrades required by this chapter may be counted toward the cost of upgrades required by  Chapter 33.440 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGreenway Overlay Zones 10/1/24 \n \n440-8 \nSubsection 33.258.070.D. However, the upgrades required by this chapter must be \ncompleted first. \n1. Thresholds triggering compliance. The standards of Subsections A, B, and C must be \nmet when the value of the proposed alterations on the site, as determined by PP&D, is \nmore than $356,300. Alterations and improvements stated in 33.258.070.D.2.a do not \ncount toward the threshold. \n2. Area of required improvements. Except as provided in 33.258.070.D.2.c(2), Exception \nfor Sites With Ground Leases, required improvements must be made to the  \nentire site. \n3. Timing and cost of required improvements. The timing and cost of the required \nimprovements is specified in 33.258.070.D.2.d. However, where 33.258.070.D.2.d \nrefers to the standards listed in Subparagraph 33.258.070.D.2.b, the standards of \nSubsections A, B, and C, above, are also included. \n33.440.240 Major Public Trails \nA. Purpose. Major public trails provide public access to and along both sides of the Willamette \nRiver. Major public trails are one of the tools used to comply with the public access \nrequirements of the Comprehensive Plan and the Willamette Greenway Plan. \nB. Major public trail requirements. All sites with a major public trail symbol shown on the \nOfficial Zoning Maps must comply with the requirements of Chapter 33.272, Major Public \nTrails, provide and install the official Greenway Trail signs as required by the Parks Bureau, \nand meet the trail design guidelines contained in the Willamette Greenway Plan. \nC. Major public trails in the River Natural and River Water Quality zones. Major public trails \nmust be designed to minimize disturbances on the natural environment of the River \nNatural and River Water Quality zoned lands. \n33.440.250 Public Viewpoints \nA. Purpose. Public viewpoints provide stopping places along the Greenway trail and the \nWillamette River where the public can view and enjoy the natural, scenic, recreational, and \neconomic qualities of the Greenway. Public viewpoints are one of the tools used to comply \nwith the public access requirements of the Comprehensive Plan and the Willamette \nGreenway Plan. \nB. Viewpoint requirements. All sites designated with a viewpoint symbol on the Willamette \nGreenway Plan are required to provide a public viewpoint. The viewpoint must meet the \nviewpoint design guidelines contained in the Willamette Greenway Plan. In addition, the \nviewpoint must comply with the Use of Trail, Hours of Use, Trespass, and Trail Maintenance \nand Liability sections of Chapter 33.272, Public Recreational Trails. In order to qualify for \nthe maintenance and liability provisions, the viewpoint must be located along the \nphysically continuous trail segment. \n33.440.260 View Corridors \nA. Purpose. View corridors provide visual access and connections to the river for \nneighborhoods and business districts who might otherwise be visually cut-off from the  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.440 \n10/1/24 Greenway Overlay Zones \n \n440-9 \nriver. View corridors are generally extensions of existing public rights-of-way through to the \nriver. View corridors are one tool used to comply with the public access requirements of \nthe Comprehensive Plan and the Willamette Greenway Plan. \nB. Provision of corridors. All view corridors identified in the Willamette Greenway Plan must \nmeet the view corridor design guidelines contained in the Willamette Greenway Plan. \n33.440.270 Nonconforming Uses and Development \nNonconforming uses and development in the greenway zones are subject to the regulations and \nreviews of Chapter 33.258, Nonconforming Situations. The additional regulations stated below apply \nto development within or riverward of the greenway setback that is not river-dependent or river-\nrelated. \nA. The development may continue. \nB. The development may be changed to an allowed river-dependent or river-related \ndevelopment by right. \nC. The development may be changed to another nonconforming development if within a \nbuilding. If it is outdoors, it may not be changed to another nonconforming development. \nD. The development may be expanded, but not within or riverward of the greenway setback \nexcept in the River Water Quality zone. In the River Water Quality zone, development may \nbe expanded within the greenway setback when the building coverage of the development \nis not increased. \nGreenway Review \n33.440.300 Purpose \nGreenway review ensures that all proposed changes to a site are consistent with the Willamette \nGreenway Plan, the Willamette Greenway design guidelines and, where applicable, the water \nquality element of Title 3 of Metro’s Urban Growth Management Functional Plan. The purpose of \ngreenway review is to ensure that: \n• Development will not have a detrimental impact on the use and functioning of the river and \nabutting lands; \n• Development will conserve, enhance and maintain the scenic qualities and natural habitat of \nlands along the river;  \n• Development will conserve the water surface of the river by limiting structures and fills \nriverward of the greenway setback; \n• Practicable alternative development options are considered, including outside the River \nWater Quality zone setback; and \n• Mitigation and enhancement activities are considered for development within the River \nWater Quality zone. \n33.440.310 When Greenway Review Applies \nUnless exempted in 33.440.320 below, the following items are subject to greenway review: \nA. New development;  Chapter 33.440 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGreenway Overlay Zones 10/1/24 \n \n440-10 \nB.

Designation of a Historic Landmark \n1. National Register listing. Structures, objects, and sites listed by the federal Keeper of \nthe National Register of Historic Places on or before January 27, 2017 are \nautomatically identified as Historic Landmarks on the Official Zoning Maps. For \nHistoric Landmarks that were listed by the federal Keeper of the National Register of \nHistoric Places on or before January 27, 2017 but have not been independently \ndesignated by the City as the result of a legislative or quasi-judicial procedure, any \nexpansion of the boundary by the federal Keeper of the National Register of Historic \nPlaces is automatically identified on the Official Zoning Maps. See Section 33.855.075, \nAutomatic Map Amendments for Historic Resources. \n2. City designation. City designation of a Historic Landmark may be established through a \nlegislative or quasi-judicial procedure. Designating a City Historic Landmark includes \nestablishing a new Historic Landmark, expanding the boundaries of an existing Historic \nLandmark, and reclassifying a noncontributing resource as contributing within the \nboundaries of an existing Historic Landmark:   \na. Legislative designation. Historic Landmark designation may be established \nthrough a legislative procedure using the approval criteria of Section \n33.846.030.D; or  \nb. Quasi-judicial designation. Historic Landmark designation may be established \nthrough a quasi-judicial procedure; historic designation review is required.  Chapter 33.445 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHistoric Resource Overlay Zone 10/1/24 \n445-4 \nB. Removal of a Historic Landmark designation \n1. Removal of a resource’s City designation as a Historic Landmark requires historic \ndesignation removal review or a legislative procedure using the approval criteria of \nSection 33.846.040.C except when the resource is destroyed or demolished as \nspecified in Paragraphs B.3. and B.4. Removing a resource’s City designation includes \nremoving an existing Historic Landmark designation, changing a Historic Landmark \ndesignation to Conservation Landmark designation, reducing the boundaries of an \nexisting Historic Landmark, and reclassifying a contributing resource as \nnoncontributing within the boundary of an existing Historic Landmark.    \n2. For Historic Landmarks that were listed by the federal Keeper of the National Register \nof Historic Places on or before January 27, 2017 but have not been independently \ndesignated by the City as the result of a legislative or quasi-judicial procedure, the \nfollowing is required: \na. Removal by the federal Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places \nautomatically removes Historic Landmark designation. Removal by the federal \nKeeper of the National Register of Historic Places also includes reducing the \nboundaries of the listed resource. See Section 33.855.075, Automatic Map \nAmendments for Historic Resources.  \nb. Removing a resource’s designation as Historic Landmark or changing the \nresource’s designation from Historic Landmark to Conservation Landmark \nrequires historic designation removal review or a legislative procedure using the \napproval criteria of Section 33.846.040.C. \n3.  If the Historic Landmark is destroyed by causes beyond the control of the owner, its \nHistoric Landmark designation is automatically removed. See Section 33.855.075, \nAutomatic Map Amendments for Historic Resources. \n4. If the Historic Landmark is demolished, after approval of demolition through \ndemolition review, its Historic Landmark designation is automatically removed. See \nSection 33.855.075, Automatic Map Amendments for Historic Resources. \nC.  Relocation of a Historic Landmark. Relocating a Historic Landmark requires historic \nresource review to ensure the resource’s historic value is considered and that there is an \nopportunity for the owner and community to consider alternatives to relocation. When a \nHistoric Landmark or contributing resource is relocated after approval of relocation \nthrough historic resource review, the designation is automatically removed from the \nsending site and is automatically added to the receiving site. See Section 33.855.075, \nAutomatic Map Amendments for Historic Resources. \nD.  Development within a Historic Landmark boundary. Certain development within the \nboundary of a Historic Landmark requires historic resource review to ensure the resource’s \nhistoric value is considered prior to or during the development process. \n1. When historic resource review is required. Unless exempted by Paragraph D.2., the \nfollowing proposals within the boundaries of a Historic Landmark are subject to \nhistoric resource review: \na.

Allow for more accurate maps and more certainty for property owners by allowing for the \nlocation of the Pleasant Valley Natural Resources overlay zone boundary to be modified \nwhen permitted changes to a resource occur or when the boundary location is determined \nmore precisely on a specific site through a more detailed study; and \nE. Provide for the replacement of resources and functional values that are lost through \nviolations of this chapter. \n33.465.220 When Pleasant Valley Resource Review is Required \nPleasant Valley resource review is required for all development in the Pleasant Valley Natural \nResources overlay zone that does not meet the development standards of Sections 33.465.150 \nthrough .180 and for violations of this chapter. Pleasant Valley Resource review is also required \nwhen an applicant wishes to fine-tune the zone boundary location based on a detailed study. The \nCity Council, Planning Commission, or Director of PP&D may initiate a Pleasant Valley resource \nreview for Pleasant Valley Natural Resources overlay zone boundary amendments to reflect \npermitted changes in the location or quality of resources or functional values. Removal of zone \nboundaries are processed as a change of an overlay zone, as stated in Chapter 33.855, Zoning Map \nAmendments. The zone boundary change procedure does not apply to changes caused by violations \nof this chapter. The procedure for violations of this chapter is described in Section 33.465.400. \n33.465.230 Procedure \nPleasant Valley Resource reviews are processed through the following procedures: \nA.

Supplemental narrative. The following is required: \n1. Impact evaluation. An impact evaluation is required to determine compliance with the \napproval criteria and to evaluate development alternatives for a particular site. The \nalternatives must be evaluated on the basis of their impact on the resources and \nfunctional values of the site. In the case of a violation, the impact evaluation is used to \ndetermine the nature and scope of the significant detrimental impacts. To the extent \nthat the site resources and functional values are part of a larger natural system such \nas a watershed, the evaluation must also consider the cumulative impacts on that \nsystem. The impact evaluation is based on the resources and functional values \nidentified as significant in the Pleasant Valley Natural Resources Protection Plan; \n \na. An impact evaluation includes: \n(1) Identification, by characteristics and quantity, of the resources and their \nfunctional values found on the site; \n(2) Evaluation of alternative locations, design modifications, or alternative \nmethods of development to determine which options reduce the significant \ndetrimental impacts on the identified resources and functional values of the \nsite; and \n(3) Determination of the alternative that best meets the applicable approval \ncriteria and identify significant detrimental impacts that are unavoidable. \nb. An impact evaluation for a violation includes: \n(1) Description, by characteristics and quantity, of the resources and functional \nvalues on the site prior to the violation; and \n(2) Determination of the impact of the violation on the resources and \nfunctional values.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.465  \n3/1/24 Pleasant Valley Natural Resources Overlay Zone  \n \n465-17 \n2. Construction management plan. Identify measures that will be taken during \nconstruction or remediation to protect the remaining resources and functional values \nat and near the construction site and provide a description of how undisturbed areas \nwill be protected. For example, describe how trees will be protected, erosion \ncontrolled, construction equipment controlled, and the timing of construction; and \n3. Mitigation or remediation plan. The purpose of a mitigation or remediation plan is to \ncompensate for unavoidable significant detrimental impacts that result from the \nchosen development alternative or violation as identified in the impact evaluation. A \nmitigation or remediation plan includes: \n•  Resources and functional values to be restored, created, or enhanced on the \nmitigation or remediation site; \n•  Documentation of coordination with appropriate local, regional, special district, \nstate, and federal regulatory agencies; \n•  Construction timetables; \n•  Operations and maintenance practices; \n•  Monitoring and evaluation procedures; \n•  Remedial actions for unsuccessful mitigation; and \n•  Information showing compliance with Section 33.248.090, Mitigation and \nRestoration Plantings. \n33.465.250 Approval Criteria \nA Pleasant Valley resource review application will be approved if the review body finds that the \napplicant has shown that all of the applicable approval criteria are met. When Pleasant Valley \nresource review is required because a proposal does not meet one or more of the development \nstandards, the approval criteria will be applied only to the aspect of the proposal that does not meet \nthe development standard or standards. \nA.

The \nprofessional will have expertise in the specific resource or functional value or in the potential \nadverse impacts on the resource or functional value. A fee for these services will be charged to the \napplicant in addition to the application fee. \n33.465.280 Modifications That Will Better Meet Pleasant Valley Resource  \nReview Requirements \nThe review body may consider modifications for site-related development standards as part of the \nPleasant Valley resource review process. These modifications are done as part of the Pleasant Valley \nresource review process and are not required to go through the adjustment process. Adjustments to \nuse-related development standards (such as floor-area ratios, intensity of use, size of the use, \nnumber of units, or concentration of uses) are subject to the adjustment process of Chapter 33.805. \nIn order to approve these modifications, the review body must find that the development will result \nin greater protection of the resources and functional values identified on the site and will, on \nbalance, be consistent with the purpose of the applicable regulations. \nNatural Resource Management Plans \n33.465.310 Purpose \nNatural resource management plans provide an alternative to case-by-case Pleasant Valley resource \nreviews. These plans provide the means to evaluate the cumulative effects of development and \nmitigation proposed at different times and in different places within the same large ecosystem. \nThese plans are of particular value in areas of multiple ownership. These plans also provide \nopportunities for coordination with, or joint adoption by, other local governments; special districts; \nand regional, state, and federal agencies.  Chapter 33.465 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nPleasant Valley Natural Resources Overlay Zone 3/1/24 \n \n465-20 \n \n33.465.320 Scope \nNatural resource management plans must cover large ecosystems such as forests, creeks, sloughs, \nor watersheds. These plans must address all resources and functional values conserved and \nprotected by the Pleasant Valley Natural Resources overlay zone within the plan boundaries. The \nplan must also address al significant detrimental impacts of uses allowed by the plan. \n33.465.330 Procedure \nAdoption and amendment of natural resource management plans is a legislative procedure. \nWhenever natural resource management plan provisions conflict with other provisions of this \nchapter, the natural resource management plan provisions supersede. Non-conflicting provisions \nsupplement the provisions of this chapter. \n33.465.340 Components \nThe applicant must submit a natural resource management plan with the following components: \nA. Management objectives to maintain or enhance resources and functional values; \nB. Lists of allowed and prohibited uses; \nC. Maps of areas where these uses are allowed and prohibited; \nD. Types of mitigation or enhancement required; \nE. Maps of areas reserved for these mitigation or enhancement actions; \nF. Timetables for development, mitigation, and enhancement; and \nG. Procedures and criteria for approving uses. \n33.465.350 Approval Criteria for Adoption and Amendment \nA natural resource management plan, or an amendment to a natural resource management plan, \nwill be approved if it meets the following approval criteria: \nA. Compliance with Sections 33.465.310 through .350; \nB. Compliance with Statewide Planning Goals and the Portland Comprehensive Plan; and \nC. If the natural resource management plan is approved as part of a plan district, the criteria \nfor adoption of plan districts in Section 33.500.050 are met. \nCorrections to Violations of This Chapter \n33.465.400 Purpose \nThe purpose of Sections 33.465.400 and .405 is to ensure the timely restoration and remediation of \nnatural resources and functional values that have been degraded due to a violation of this chapter. \nThese sections establish a process to determine which review requirements will be applied to \nremedy a violation that takes place in the Pleasant Valley natural resources overlay zone. The type \nof review required depends on the circumstances of the violation. Section 33.465.405 details \nmethods for correcting such violations and Title 3 of the City Code details the  \nenforcement penalties.

The \nzone achieves this by limiting residential densities and by requiring noise insulation, noise disclosure \nstatements, and noise easements. \n33.470.020 Short Name and Map Symbol \nThe Portland International Airport Noise Impact Overlay Zone is also referred to as the PDX Noise \nzone, and is shown on the Official Zoning Maps with a letter \"x\" map symbol (for PDX). \n33.470.030 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of the chapter apply within the Portland International Airport Noise Impact  \nOverlay Zone. There are several contours within the zone. The boundaries of the 65 DNL and 68 \nDNL noise contours are based on the 1990 Portland International Airport Noise Abatement Plan. \nThe 55 DNL noise contour is based on the 2035 50th Percentile Forecast Noise Exposure Map in the \n2010 Portland International Airport Master Plan Update. \nA set of quarter-section maps, known as the PDX Noise Zone Maps, is available for viewing at the \nDevelopment Services Center. The maps are the official reference maps for the PDX Noise Zone \nregulations. The maps show the 55 DNL noise contour and each successively higher noise contour in \none DNL increments.  \n33.470.035 Corrections \nAn owner may request that the Planning and Sustainability Director initiate a correction to the \nlocation of the noise contours shown on the PDX Noise Zone Maps for their property. The owner \nmust show, and the Director must find, that the noise contours do not conform with the location \nshown in the 1990 Portland International Airport Noise Abatement Plan Update for the location of \nthe 65 and 68 DNL contours, or the 2010 Portland International Airport Master Plan Update for the \nlocation of the 55 DNL contour. Corrections are processed as stated in Section 1.01.037 of the \nPortland City Code. \n33.470.040 Regulations for Residential Uses  \nA. Noise disclosure statement in the 55, 65, and 68 DNL. The regulations of this subsection \napply to sites in the 55, 65, and 68 DNL contours. Before a building permit is issued for new \nresidential construction or reconstruction where the total cost of improvements is 75  Chapter 33.470 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nPortland International Airport Noise Impact Zone 5/13/11 \n \n470-2 \npercent or more of the total assessed improvement value of the site, the owner must sign \nthe City's noise disclosure statement. The noise disclosure statement acknowledges that \nthe property is located within the 55, 65, or 68 DNL noise contour and signifies the owner's \nawareness of the associated noise levels. The noise disclosure statement must be recorded \nin the County records by the owner. A packet containing the noise disclosure statement is \navailable at the Development Services Center. \nB. Noise easement in the 65 and 68 DNL. The regulations of this subsection apply to sites in \nthe 65 and 68 DNL contours. Before a building permit is issued for new residential \nconstruction or reconstruction where the total cost of improvements is 75 percent or \nmore of the total assessed improvement value of the site, the owner must dedicate a \nnoise easement to the Port of Portland. The easement authorizes aircraft noise impacts \nover the grantor's property at levels established by the DNL noise contour. Any increase of \nthe DNL noise level above that stated on the easement will not void nor be protected by \nthe easement. The easement forms are available at the Development Services Center.  \nC. Noise insulation required in 65 and 68 DNL. The regulations of this subsection apply to \nsites in the 65 and 68 DNL contours. New dwelling units allowed by this chapter within the \n65 and 68 DNL contours must be constructed with sound insulation or other means to \nachieve a day/night average interior noise level of 45 dBA. Reconstructed dwelling units \nwhere the total cost of improvements is 75 percent or more of the total assessed \nimprovement value of the site must also meet this standard. Garages and similar accessory \nstructures that do not include living area are not subject to this requirement. \n1. Certified by acoustical engineer. An engineer registered in Oregon who is licensed in \nacoustical engineering must certify that the building plans comply with the \nperformance standard for sound insulation prior to the issuance of a building permit. \n2. City provides list. The City, in consultation with the Port of Portland, will provide a list \nof at least three registered engineers licensed in acoustical engineering. \n3. Port of Portland pays for sound insulation certification. At an owner's request, the \nPort of Portland is responsible for the costs of the noise insulation certification of \ndwelling units submitted by an engineer on the City list. The Port of Portland will pay \nfor the cost of the certification required by this section, but not design, materials, or \nlabor costs associated with installing the sound insulation. The owner has the option \nto retain any registered engineer licensed in acoustical engineering not on the list, at \nthe owner's expense. \nD. Residential use and density. \n1. Within the 68 DNL noise contour. Where any part of a site is within the 68 DNL noise \ncontour, it is subject to the following: \na. New residential uses.  \n(1) New residential uses prohibited. New residential uses are prohibited within \nthe 68 DNL or higher noise contour except as allowed specifically by this \nsubsection. If a site is divided by a 68 DNL noise contour all dwelling units \nmust be located entirely outside the 68 DNL noise contour.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.470 \n3/1/20 Portland International Airport Noise Impact Zone \n \n470-3 \n(2) Exemption. Sites that had a Farm and Forest, Limited Single Family, Low \nDensity Single Family, or Medium Density Single Family Comprehensive Plan \nMap designation on January 1, 1981 or a County Residential Comprehensive \nPlan designation or zoning on that date are exempt from this prohibition. \nDwelling units added to these sites must meet the requirements of this \nchapter for residential development within the 65 DNL contour. \nb. Replacement housing.  \n(1)  Existing housing within the 68 DNL noise contour may be replaced within 5 \nyears if it is damaged or destroyed by fire or other causes beyond the \ncontrol of the owner. A houseboat that is intentionally removed from its slip \nby the owner may be replaced within 5 years. A manufactured dwelling that \nis intentionally removed from a manufactured dwelling park may be \nreplaced within 5 years. \n(2)  Natural disasters. The replacement time of 5 years is extended to 15 years \nfor manufactured dwelling parks if: \n• Manufactured dwelling units are damaged or destroyed by a natural \ndisaster such as a flood, earthquake, fire or other causes beyond the \ncontrol of the manufactured dwelling park owner; and \n• At least 30 percent of the manufactured dwelling units in the \nmanufactured dwelling park are either destroyed or significantly \ndamaged. A unit is significantly damaged if the repair cost is 75 percent \nof the value of the unit. \n2. Within the 65 DNL noise contour. Where a site is within the 65 DNL noise contour, it is \nsubject to the following: \na. Sites that have a residential Comprehensive Plan Map designation are prohibited \nfrom developing to a residential density higher than that of the R10 zone. \nb. Except as provided in paragraph D.3, sites that have a commercial \nComprehensive Plan Map designation are prohibited from developing to a \nresidential density higher than that of the RM2 zone. \n3.

Prime \nIndustrial Land is suited for traded-sector and supportive industries and possesses characteristics \nthat are difficult to replace in the region. In Portland, Prime Industrial land consists of the Portland \nHarbor, Columbia Corridor, and Brooklyn Yard industrial districts. These freight-hub districts include \nOregon’s largest seaport, rail hub, and airport. Existing and potential multimodal freight access in \nthese districts support interregional transport, exporting industries, and associated industrial \nbusinesses and activities. The regulations protect these areas by preventing, or requiring an off-set \nfor, conversion of the land to another zone or use that would reduce industrial development \ncapacity.  \n33.471.020 Map Symbol \nThe Prime Industrial overlay zone is shown on the Official Zoning Maps with the “k” symbol. \n33.471.030 Applying the Prime Industrial overlay zone \nThe Prime Industrial overlay zone is to be applied to all land designated as Prime Industrial in the \nComprehensive Plan except for land that is zoned Open Space.  \n33.471.040 Initiating a Quasi-judicial Comprehensive Plan Map amendment.  \nIn the Prime Industrial overlay zone, an applicant is prohibited from initiating a quasi-judicial \nComprehensive Plan Map amendment unless the amendment is from Mixed Employment to \nIndustrial Sanctuary. \nUse Regulations  \n33.471.050 Self-Service Storage \nSelf-Service Storage is prohibited in the Prime Industrial overlay zone.

This purpose is achieved by applying  Chapter 33.475 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Overlay Zones 3/1/24 \n \n475-2 \nregulations that control development of land, change of use and intensification of use. The \nregulations reflect the desired character of the Central and South reaches of the Willamette River — \na character that includes: \n• A healthy river, floodplain, and watershed; \n• A thriving riverfront with regional gathering spaces, active and passive recreational uses, \nmaritime and commercial activities, and a welcoming mixed-use community; and \n• Access to, along and in the river.   \nThe River Overlay Zones also implement the City’s responsibilities under ORS 390.310 to 390.368.  \n33.475.020 River Overlay Zones \nA. Purpose. The River Overlay zones implement the land use pattern identified in the Central \nCity 2035 Plan (2020) and River Plan / South Reach (2020). There are three River Overlay \nzones each with their own purpose: \n1. River General. The River General overlay zone allows for uses and development that \nare consistent with the base zoning and allows for public use and enjoyment of the \nriverfront.   \n2. River Recreational. The River Recreational overlay zone encourages river-dependent \nand river-related recreational uses, which provide a variety of types of public access \nto, along, and in the river, and which enhance the river’s natural and scenic qualities. \n3. River Environmental. The River Environmental overlay zone protects, conserves and \nenhances important natural resource functions and values while allowing \nenvironmentally sensitive development. The purpose of the zone is to limit the \nimpacts from development and vegetation maintenance on the natural resources and \nfunctional values contained within the overlay zone. The River Environmental \nregulations encourage flexibility and innovation in site planning and provide for \ndevelopment that is carefully designed to be sensitive to the site’s protected \nresources. Mitigation is required for unavoidable impacts and is intended to \ncompensate for impacts and improve natural resource features or functions over \ntime. The River Environmental overlay zone applies to specific natural resource areas \nidentified in two detailed studies: the Willamette River Central Reach Natural \nResources Protection Plan (2020) and the River Plan / South Reach Natural Resources \nProtection Plan (2020).  \nB.

Submission of photographs of the site are not required but are \nencouraged to supplement the existing conditions site plan. \nC. Mitigation bank credits. If credits will be purchased from a City-approved mitigation \nbank to satisfy the requirements of 33.475.440.L, the applicant must provide proof of \nthe purchase of credits. \nRiver General and River Recreational Overlay Zones \n33.475.200 Use Regulation  \nA. River General overlay zone. There are no special use restrictions in the River General \noverlay zone.  \nB. River Recreational overlay zone. Primary uses in the River Recreational overlay zone \nare limited to recreational uses that are river-dependent or river-related. On sites \nshown on Map 475-5, Retail Sales and Service use is allowed as an accessory use when \nthe total amount of Retail Sales and Service use does not exceed 1,500 square feet of \nnet building area. \n33.475.210 River Setback  \nA. Purpose. The purpose of the river setback is to keep structures separated from the river in \nareas where the land is not being reserved for river-dependent and river-related uses. \nSeparating structures from the river facilitates protection, maintenance, restoration, \npreservation and enhancement of the natural, scenic, historic and recreational qualities of \nthe Willamette River by reserving space for the conservation and enhancement of natural \nvegetation and the opportunity for public access. In addition, OAR 660-015-0005 requires \nthe establishment of a setback line. \nB. General. The requirements of this section focus on whether the development is river-\ndependent or river-related. The focus is not on the primary use of the land. For example, in \nthe River General overlay zone, a marine transportation terminal is a river-dependent \nprimary use, but not all development associated with the terminal is river-dependent. The \ndock is river-dependent, but the parking lot and offices are not.  \nC. The river setback. The river setback extends from the top of the bank to a point 50 feet \nlandward of the top of bank. See Figure 475-1. Top of bank is shown on Map 475-2. Where \ntop of bank is not shown on Map 475-2, top of bank is determined as described in \n33.910.030, Definitions, and 33.930.150, Measuring Top of Bank. Where top of bank is \nshown on Map 475-2, applicants may choose to determine top of bank as described in \n33.910.030, Definitions, and 33.930.150, Measuring Top of Bank. \n \nWhere alteration to the river bank carried out to meet 33.475.440.H results in the top of \nbank shifting landward, the applicant may choose to measure the setback from the original \ntop of bank. When this occurs, a survey of the original top of bank line and new top of bank \nline must be submitted for verification that the top of bank has been measured according \nto the standard in 33.930.150, Measuring Top of Bank, and then recorded with the County \nrecorder. In all cases the river setback line must be at least 5 feet landward of the new top \nof bank line.

Development, exterior alterations, \nexcavations, and fills landward of the river setback are not required to be river-\ndependent or river-related. \n2. Development within or riverward of the river setback. Except as follows, development, \nexterior alterations, excavations, and fills within or riverward of the river setback must \nbe river-dependent or river-related:  \na. Development, exterior alterations, excavations, and fills that are not river-\ndependent or river-related are allowed to encroach into the river setback as \ndescribed in Subsection E. Development, exterior alterations, excavations, and \nfills located riverward of the setback must be river-dependent or river-related, \nexcept as allowed by 33.475.250.D; \nb. Development within a Historic or Conservation landmark located within or \nriverward of the river setback is not required to be river-dependent or river-\nrelated, and the floor area of the landmark and the exterior improvement area \nassociated with the landmark can be increased up to a total of 10 percent within \nthe river setback when the alteration does not bring the building or exterior \nimprovement area closer to the river. \nc. All other development, exterior alterations, excavations, and fills that are not \nriver-dependent or river-related are allowed if approved through a Greenway \nGoal Exception. \nE. Encroachment into the setback. Development that is not river-dependent or river-related \nmay encroach up to 5 feet into the river setback provided that the setback is increased by \nan area equivalent in size to the encroachment area. The area that is increased must be \nlocated adjacent to the original setback. See Figure 475-2.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.475 \n3/1/24 River Overlay Zones \n \n475-7 \nFigure 475-2 \nEncroachment into the River Setback  \n \n33.475.215 Marine Passenger Docks and Terminals  \nA. Purpose. River-related development provides goods or services that are directly associated \nwith river-dependent land or waterway use. River-related development is typically allowed \nwithin the river setback, however certain river-related development associated with a \nmarine passenger dock, while river-related in nature, does not need to be fully located \nwithin the river setback. In order to ensure that these particular types of river-related \ndevelopment do not overwhelm or dominate within the river setback, the total amount of \nfootprint allowed within the setback is limited. The limitation will ensure that the river \nsetback can accommodate other river-related or river-dependent development and \nprovide opportunities for recreation, public access, and the conservation and enhancement \nof natural, scenic and historic resources.  \nB. Standard. Passenger waiting and queuing areas, security checkpoints, and machine shops \nassociated with marine passenger docks for subregional travel or marine passenger \nterminals for regional travel are limited to a 5,000 square foot footprint within or riverward \nof the river setback.  Chapter 33.475 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Overlay Zones 3/1/24 \n \n475-8 \n33.475.220 Landscaping  \nThe following regulations apply to new development and exterior alterations to existing \ndevelopment in the River General and River Recreational overlay zones.  \nA. Purpose. The landscaping regulations are intended to increase vegetation along the \nWillamette River. Adding a diversity of vegetation within the river setback will improve \nmultiple ecosystem functions, increase fish and wildlife habitat, provide shade, cool the air, \nand create visual diversity. The regulations are also intended to accommodate safe and \nenjoyable public access to and along the Willamette River.  \nB. Required landscaping.  \n1. Governor Tom McCall Waterfront Park and the Eastbank Crescent beach, shown on \nMap 475-3, are exempt from this Section. \n2. Required landscaping for all other areas. For areas not exempt from this section, land \nwithin and riverward of the river setback that is not covered with a building or other \nstructure, existing vehicle area, or developed with a trail or viewing area must be \nlandscaped to meet Table 475-1, Landscaping Planting Density. Subareas are shown \non Figure 475-3 and described below. There are three planting densities allowed \nwithin each subarea. The applicant may choose which planting density standard to \napply within each subarea, and more than one planting density may occur on a site. \nFor example, the applicant may choose planting density 1 for all the subareas, or \nplanting density 2 for subarea 1, planting density 3 for subarea 2, and planting density \n1 for subarea 3.  \na.  Subareas: \n(1) Subarea 1 extends from the ordinary high water mark to the top of bank of \nthe Willamette River. \n(2) Subarea 2 extends from the top of bank to a point 25 feet landward of the \ntop of bank of the Willamette River. \n(3) Subarea 3 extends from a point 25 feet landward of the top of bank to a \npoint 50 feet landward of the top of bank of the Willamette River (top of \nbank is shown on Map 475-2). When the setback area is increased in \nconformance with 33.475.210.E., Encroachment into the setback, Subarea 3 \nextends into the increased setback area.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.475 \n10/1/24 River Overlay Zones \n \n475-9 \nFigure 475-3 \nLandscaping Area \n \nb. Vegetation planted to meet the resource enhancement standards of 33.475.440. \nH or the mitigation standards of 33.475.440.L may be counted towards meeting \nthe landscaping standard. \nc. Exceptions.  \n(1) Landscaping is not required within portions of sites where contamination \nremoval or remediation actions meet the standards of 33.475.500;  \n(2) Landscaping is not required where the Fire Marshal finds that it would pose \na safety hazard;  \n(3) Trees and shrubs are not required within utility easements but the area \nmust be seeded with a grass and forb seed mix at a ratio of 30 pounds per \nacre; \n(4) Trees and shrubs are not required within a Scenic overlay zone but the area \nmust be seeded with a grass and forb seed mix at a ratio of 30 pounds per \nacre. Trees may not be planted within a Scenic overlay zone; or \n(5) If the area to be landscaped within subarea 1 has an average slope of 30 \npercent or steeper (30 percent slope represents a rise over run ratio of \n1:3.3) and the area with an average slope of 30 percent or steeper is \narmored with rip rap, or the area within subarea 1 has rip rap that is at least \nfour feet deep, then the required subarea 1 landscaping may be planted on \nan area of the site that is landward of the river setback but within the River \noverlay zones, or the applicant may pay a revegetation fee-in-lieu as \ndescribed below. If the landscaping will be provided on-site, the total area \noutside of subarea 1 to be landscaped must be equivalent in size to the area \nthat would have been required to be landscaped in subarea 1. More than \none landscaped area may be provided to achieve the total, but other \nrequired landscaping may not count toward the total: \n• Revegetation fee-in-lieu use and administration. The revegetation fee is \ncollected by Portland Permitting & Development and is administered by  Chapter 33.475 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Overlay Zones 10/1/24 \n \n475-10 \nthe Bureau of Environmental Services (BES). The fees collected are used \nfor revegetation projects on public or private property within the River \nEnvironmental overlay zone. \n• Calculation of required fee-in-lieu contributions. Applicants must \ncontribute the cost to purchase and plant trees, shrubs and \ngroundcover plants as set out in the next bullet. The cost to purchase \nand plant trees and plants will be adjusted annually as determined by \nthe Director of BES based on current market prices for materials, labor \nand maintenance. \n• Required fee-in-lieu contribution. The applicant must contribute the \ncost to purchase, plant and maintain one tree, three shrubs and four \nground cover plants per 100 square feet of required planting area \nbefore a building permit will be issued. The fee calculation will be \nrounded up to the next multiple of $10. The minimum area to be used \nin this calculation is 100 square feet. Calculations that are not a multiple \nof 100 will be rounded up to the next multiple of 100.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.475  \n3/1/24 River Overlay Zones  \n \n475-13 \n1. Thresholds triggering compliance. The requirements of Subsections B, C, and D must \nbe met when the value of the proposed alterations on the site, as determined by \nPP&D, is more than $308,100. Alterations and improvements stated in \n33.258.070.D.2.a do not count toward the threshold. \n2. Area of required improvements. Except as provided in 33.258.070.D.2.c(2), Exception \nfor Sites with Ground Leases, required improvements must be made to the entire site. \n3. Timing and cost of required improvements. The timing and cost of the required \nimprovements is specified in 33.258.070.D.2.d. However, where 33.258.070.D.2.d \nrefers to the standards listed in Subparagraph 33.258.070.D.2.b, the standards of \nSubsections A, B, C, and D, above, are also included. \n33.475.225 Residential Docks  \nA. Purpose. The residential docks standard is intended to:  \n• Limit the impacts of new docks on shallow water habitat areas, which are critical for the \nsurvival of a variety of aquatic species;  \n• Minimize harmful shading that predatory fish species use to prey on fish species listed \nunder the Endangered Species Act;  \n• Minimize disruption to water flow patterns and natural sediment transport along the \nshoreline; and \n• Maintain access to important foraging areas for waterfowl and other wildlife.  \nB. Residential dock standards. The following standards apply to new floating boat docking \nstructures located in a residential zone. \n1. The total square footage of the new floating boat docking structure must not exceed \n200 square feet. Adjustments are prohibited; and  \n2.  The new floating boat docking structure may not be located within shallow water \nhabitat. Adjustments are prohibited. Modifications are allowed through river review. \n33.475.230 Exterior Lighting  \nA. Purpose. The standards for exterior lighting are intended to: \n• Minimize light glare and light spill from artificial lighting and associated negative \nimpacts on fish and wildlife and their habitats;  \n• Reduce light pollution and glare impacts on residential developments;  \n• Maintain public safety and security along public trails, in parks, along public streets, \nand on piers and gangways; and  \n• Provide flexibility for river-dependent operations associated with docks.  \nB. General standards. The following standards apply to all exterior lights located within the \nRiver General overlay zone. \n1. Exterior lights must not project light upward or to the side of the fixture; \n2. The top and sides of all exterior light fixtures must be shielded with 100 percent \nopaque materials; and   Chapter 33.475 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Overlay Zones 3/1/24 \n475-14 \n \n3.  Lamps must fall below 3000K or within an S/P ratio range of 1 to 1.2. \nC. Additional standards for areas near the Willamette River. The following standards apply \nto all permanent exterior lights located within and riverward of the river setback, and all \npermanent exterior lights located within 25 feet landward of the river setback. Exterior \nlights within Governor Tom McCall Waterfront Park, and exterior lights within public \nstreets are exempt from this Subsection:  \n1. Exterior lights are allowed only if the lights are for the following uses or development:  \na. Park and Open Area uses;  \nb. The major public trail; \nc. A public viewing area; or  \nd. River-dependent or river-related development. \n2. Structures that support exterior light fixtures must be set back at least 5 feet from the \ntop of bank of the Willamette River unless the structure that supports the exterior \nlight fixture is located on a dock, pier and gangway, and must be setback at least 30 \nfeet from any other stream, drainageway, wetland or water body (top of bank is \nshown on Map 475-2);  \n3. Structures that support exterior light fixtures must be spaced at least 25 feet apart; \nand \n4. Exterior lights must not project directly into the Willamette River. \n33.475.235 Bird-safe Glazing \nA. Purpose. The bird-safe glazing standards are intended to reduce the risk of bird-to-building \ncollisions. The standards reduce the transparency, or reflectivity, of exterior windows and \nother glazed surfaces, thereby improving the visibility of exterior glazed surfaces to birds. \nThe reduction in transparency applies to the portions of buildings that studies show are \nassociated with the greatest occurrence of bird strikes.   \nB. Development subject to the bird-safe exterior glazing standards. The bird-safe glazing \nstandards apply to new buildings and major remodeling projects in the South Reach. See \nMap 475-1. For new buildings, the standards apply per facade when the façade has 30 \npercent or more glazing, including spandrel glazing, within the first 60 feet measured from \nthe grade adjacent to the façade. For major remodeling projects, the standards apply per \nfaçade when at least 75 percent of the façade is altered and the altered façade has 30 \npercent or more glazing, including spandrel glazing, within the first 60 feet measured from \nthe grade adjacent to the facade. The standards also apply to glazing located directly \nadjacent to an ecoroof, roof garden, or other vegetated or landscaped roof area. The \nstandards do not apply to houses, attached houses, manufactured homes, accessory \ndwelling units, duplexes, attached duplexes, triplexes, historic landmarks, and contributing \nresources in historic or conservation districts.   \nC. Bird-safe exterior glazing standards. At least 90 percent of the windows and glazing on the \nfollowing portions of each façade must choose treatment patterns and application \ntechniques from the Portland Bird Safe Windows List:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.475 \n10/1/24 River Overlay Zones \n \n475-11 \n \nTable 475-1  \nLandscaping Planting Density \nSubarea Planting Density 1: \nSmall Trees[1] \nPlanting Density 2: \nMedium Trees[1] \nPlanting Density 3: \nLarge Trees[1] \nLandscaping Subarea \n1 \nAt least one tree, three \nshrubs, and four other ground \ncover plants must be planted \nfor every 100 square feet of \nsubarea. \n \nTrees may be clustered.

All \nplants must be native. \nAt least one tree, nine shrubs, \nand 12 other ground cover \nplants must be planted for \nevery 300 square feet of \nsubarea.  \n \nTrees may be clustered. All \nplants must be native. \nLandscaping \nSubarea 2 \nOption 1: Same as Subarea 1 \n \nOption 2. At least one tree \nand three shrubs must be \nplanted for every 100 square \nfeet of subarea, and the \nentire subarea must be \nseeded with a grass and forb \nseed mix at a ratio of 30 \npounds per acre.  \n \nTrees may be clustered. \n \nOption 1: Same as Subarea 1 \n \nOption 2: At least one tree and \nsix shrubs must be planted for \nevery 200 square feet of \nsubarea, and the entire \nsubarea must be seeded with a \ngrass and forb seed mix at a \nratio of 30 pounds per acre.  \n \nTrees may be clustered. \nOption 1: Same as Subarea 1 \n \nOption 2. At least one tree and \nnine shrubs must be planted for \nevery 300 square feet of \nsubarea, and the entire subarea \nmust be seeded with a grass \nand forb seed mix at a ratio of \n30 pounds per acre  \n \nTrees may be clustered. \nLandscaping \nSubarea 3 \nAt least one tree must be \nplanted for every 100 square \nfeet of subarea, and the \nentire subarea must be \nseeded with a grass and forb \nseed mix at a ratio of 30 \npounds per acre.  \n \nIf shrubs are provided, a \nminimum 3 shrubs must be \nplanted for every 100 square \nfeet of subarea.  \n \nTrees may be clustered. \n \nAt least one tree must be \nplanted for every 200 square \nfeet of subarea, and the entire \nsubarea must be seeded with a \ngrass and forb seed mix at a \nratio of 30 pounds per acre.  \n \nIf shrubs are provided, a \nminimum of 6 shrubs must be \nplanted for every 200 square \nfeet of subarea.   \n \nTrees may be clustered.  \n \nAt least one tree must be \nplanted for every 300 square \nfeet of subarea, and the entire \nsubarea must be seeded with a \ngrass and forb seed mix at a \nratio of 30 pounds per acre.  \n \nIf shrubs are provided, a \nminimum of 9 shrubs must be \nplanted for every 300 square \nfeet of subarea.   \n \nTrees may be clustered. \n[1]Tree size is based on Title 11.60.020.C Canopy Size Chapter 33.475 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Overlay Zones 3/1/24 \n475-12 \n \nC. Landscaped area site preparation. Before installing the required landscaping, the following \nstandards must be met: \n1. All prohibited and nuisance plants listed on the Portland Plant List must be removed \nwithin and riverward of the river setback. \n2. All structures and debris located within and riverward of the river setback must be \nremoved except for river-dependent and river-related structures, non-conforming \ndevelopment, erosion control measures, flood control facilities, large wood, and \nbioengineered structures. Examples of bioengineered structures include bundles of \nplant materials or soil cells wrapped in biodegradable fabrics.  \n3. If the area to be planted is not currently vegetated, the soil must be amended with 12 \ninches of growing medium. If the planting area is in subarea 1 has an average slope of \n30 percent or steeper (30 percent slope represents a rise over run ratio of 1:3.3), and \nis armored with rip rap, the growing medium may be placed in planting wells. The \ncomposition of the growing medium must meet one of the following: \na. For all planting areas located outside of the combined flood hazard area, the \ngrowing medium must be a blend of loamy soil, sand, and compost that is 30 to \n40 percent plant material compost (by volume); or  \nb. For all planting areas located within the combined flood hazard area, the growing \nmedium must be a blend of loamy soil, sand, small gravels and compost. A \nlandscape architect or civil engineer must certify that the growing medium is \nadequate to support the establishment and growth of vegetation, and that any \ngrowing medium to be located in subarea 1 is heavier than water. \n4. Placement of the growing medium is not allowed when the ground is frozen or \nsaturated; and  \n5. Temporary erosion control measures are required until permanent stabilization \nmeasures are functional. Temporary erosion control measures must be biodegradable \nor removed after permanent stabilization measures are functional or within 3 years, \nwhichever is sooner. \nD. Plant requirements. Trees must be a minimum ½-inch caliper, bareroot, or live stakes, \nunless they are oak or madrone, which may be one gallon size. Shrubs must be a minimum \nof one gallon size or bareroot. All other species must be a minimum of four-inch pots or \nequivalent. For planting areas over 600 square feet, at least two different tree species and \nsizes, three different shrub species, and four different groundcover species must be used. \nE. Exception for sites with an existing nonconforming use, allowed use, limited use, or \nconditional use. The regulations of this subsection apply to sites with an existing \nnonconforming use, an allowed use, a limited use, or a conditional use. When alterations \nare made to a site that does not meet the requirements of this section, and the alterations \nare over the threshold of Paragraph E.1, the site must be brought into conformance with \nthe development standards of this Section. The value of the alterations is based on the \nentire project, not individual building permits. The cost of the upgrades required by this \nchapter may be counted toward the cost of upgrades required by Subsection 33.258.070.D. \nHowever, the upgrades required by this chapter must be completed first.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.475  \n3/1/24 River Overlay Zones  \n \n475-15 \n1. Windows and glazing, including glazed balcony railings, located within the first 60 feet \nof the building measured from the grade adjacent to the facade;  \n2. Windows and glazing located within the first 15 feet of the building above an adjacent \necoroof, roof garden, or other vegetated or landscaped roof area; and  \n3. The glazed portions of sky bridges or fences. \n33.475.245 Archaeological Resources Protection \nA. Purpose. Archaeological and historical evidence shows that Native Americans lived along \nthe Columbia and Willamette rivers in the Portland region prior to European American \ncontact and settlement. Pre-contact archaeological resources have historic, cultural, and \nscientific value to the general public and associated Native American tribes, whose \nancestors lived in the area and harvested natural resources for subsistence and \nspiritual/ceremonial uses. Of special concern is the potential for ground disturbing \nactivities to uncover human remains and archaeological resources that may be eligible for \nlisting on the National Register of Historic Places. The regulations of this section provide a \nprocess to survey areas with a high probability of having archaeological resources prior to \nground disturbing activities and development and to protect any identified archaeological \nresources and their functional values. \nB. Definitions. The following definitions apply for the purposes of implementing this section: \n1. Archaeological resource. A resource identified by the State Historic Preservation Office \n(SHPO) that meets one or both of the following: \na. An archaeological site associated with use by Native Americans prior to \nEuropean-American contact that meets SHPO guidelines plus a 5-foot vertical \nbuffer and a 5-foot horizontal buffer. The vertical buffer extends directly above \nthe most shallow archaeological materials found in the site records. The \nhorizontal buffer extends sideways from the archaeological resource. See Figure \n475-4; or \nb. A property of traditional religious and cultural importance as identified by SHPO \nand documented in writing by an appropriate tribe. \n2. Transition area. The transition area is the area directly between the archaeological \nresource and the surface layer and extends horizontally from the edge of the \narchaeological resource, as described below. See Figure 475-4. Archaeological features \nassociated with a resource may also be encountered in the transition area: \na. For burials and villages, the horizontal distance is 100 feet from the \narchaeological resource. \nb. For seasonal campsites; activity areas; and traditional, sacred, or cultural use \nsites, the horizontal distance is 50 feet from the archaeological resource. \n3. Appropriate tribe. One or more tribes identified by the Oregon Legislative Commission \non Indian Services or the Washington Governor's Office of Indian Affairs as having the \ngreatest interest in the archaeological resource.  Chapter 33.475 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Overlay Zones 3/1/24 \n475-16 \n \n4. Qualified archaeologist. An archaeologist on the SHPO list of qualified archaeologists \nknowledgeable in Native American lifeways in the Portland Basin in the pre-contact \nperiod. \n5. Consultation with appropriate tribes. A process that follows SHPO procedures for \ntribal consultation on state archaeological permits. \nFigure 475-4 \nArcheological Resource Subarea \n \n \nC. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply within the high \nsensitivity areas shown on Map 475-4. \nD. When these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to new development \nand alterations to existing development when the development causes more than 200 \nsquare feet of disturbance within the high sensitivity area. \nE. Archaeological resource identification. Prior to new development or alteration to existing \ndevelopment, the applicant must identify whether archaeological resources exist in the \nhigh sensitivity area. If archaeological resources exist, then the regulations of Subsections \nF. and G. apply. If no archaeological resources exist, then the regulations of Subsection F. \nand G. do not apply. The applicant must identify whether archaeological resources exist \nusing one of the following two methods: \n1. Written documentation. The applicant must provide documentation that specifies that \nthe high sensitivity area has been previously surveyed and that no archaeological \nresource was identified. The written documentation must be a certification letter from \nSHPO or a zoning confirmation letter from the Portland Bureau of Planning and \nSustainability; or  \n2. Archaeological survey. The applicant must conduct an archaeological survey to \ndetermine whether archaeological resources exist in the high sensitivity area. The \narchaeological survey must meet the following standards:    Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.475  \n3/1/24 River Overlay Zones  \n \n475-17 \na. A qualified archaeologist must perform the survey in consultation with \nappropriate tribes. \nb. The survey must include a pedestrian visual inspection of the ground surface of \nthe high sensitivity area. The methodology of the pedestrian visual inspection \nshall be determined by the qualified archaeologist. \nc. The survey must include a subsurface investigation with at least 1 subsurface \nprobe. The methodology of the subsurface investigation, including the number, \nlocation and dimensions of subsurface probes shall be determined by the \nqualified archaeologist. \nd. A survey report describing the methodology of the survey and whether any \narchaeological resources were found in the high sensitivity area must be \nsubmitted to the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability. If no archaeological \nresource is found, BPS will provide a zoning confirmation letter to the applicant \nwaiving any additional compliance with this section. If the survey identifies an \narchaeological resource, the applicant must provide the following additional \nmaterials. In the interest of not disclosing the location of archaeological \nresources, the materials required below will be stamped \"Confidential: Sensitive \nInformation.\" Bureau of Planning and Sustainability and Portland Permitting & \nDevelopment staff will treat these materials in accordance with the City’s \nnondisclosure policies: \n(1) Site plan. A site plan, at a scale of 1 inch = 50 feet or larger, showing the \nbuilding footprints, underground utilities and all other proposed ground \ndisturbing activities, and an estimated ground disturbance depth. The site \nplan must show the existing topography of the site; \n(2) Archaeological survey map. A map showing the locations of all subsurface \nprobes completed for the site;  \n(3) Archaeological resource map. A map showing the boundaries of all \narchaeological resources that are recorded with SHPO or encountered \nduring the archaeological survey. The map must also show the transition \narea associated with each archaeological resource and any conservation \neasements intended to protect archaeological resources. The Bureau of \nPlanning and Sustainability will maintain a confidential atlas of identified \narchaeological resources within the archaeological sensitivity areas shown \non Map 475-4; and \n(4) SHPO archaeological reports. Any archaeological reports related to the site \nfiled with SHPO. \nF. Archaeological resource classification. When an archaeological resource has been \nidentified, a qualified archaeologist must classify the archaeological resource as one or \nmore of the following types: \n1.  Burial. A burial is an archaeological resource where there is evidence of human \nremains or funerary objects, as defined in Oregon Administrative Rules.  Chapter 33.475 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Overlay Zones 3/1/24 \n475-18 \n \n2. Village. A village is an archaeological resource where there is evidence of a relatively \npermanent residential location typically occupied during the winter and on an annual \nbasis. Archaeological evidence may include remains of structures, storage pits, and \nmidden deposits. \n3. Seasonal campsite. A seasonal campsite is an archaeological resource where there is \nevidence of organized activity in extracting and processing resources on a seasonal \nbasis.  \n4. Activity area. An activity area is an archaeological resource where specific activity \n(e.g., roasting camas bulbs or stone tool making) took place.  \n5. Traditional, sacred, or cultural use site. A traditional, sacred, or cultural use site is an \narchaeological resource where there is evidence of a sacred or ceremonial site, and \nmay include vision quest sites, sites of other sacred ceremonies, and sweat lodge sites. \nG. Archaeological resource protection standards. The following standards apply to identified \narchaeological resources: \n1. Application of development standards. Where more than one archaeological resource \nis identified together: \na. If one of the archaeological resources is a burial, the standards for burials apply \nto all resources; \nb. If any of the archaeological resources are villages; or traditional, sacred, or \ncultural use sites, and there is no burial, the standards for villages; or traditional, \nsacred, or cultural use sites apply to all resources; \nc. If all of the archaeological resources are seasonal campsites or activity areas, the \nstandards for seasonal campsites or activity areas apply to all resources. \n2. Ground disturbing activities within the archaeological resource and transition area are \nprohibited except as follows: \na. Ongoing and low-impact activities. Except for the archaeological resource area of \nburials, the following ongoing and low-impact activities are allowed in \narchaeological resource and transition areas: \n(1) Maintenance, repair, and replacement of existing structures, exterior \nimprovements, roads, boat launch areas, and utilities when the activity does \nnot enlarge the existing disturbance area horizontally or vertically; \n(2) Maintenance of lawns and landscape areas, including the installation of new \nirrigation and drainage facilities, and new erosion control features; \n(3) Change of crop type or farming technique on land currently in agricultural \nuse;  \n(4) Alterations of buildings that do not increase building coverage;   \n(5) Operation, maintenance, and repair of the following existing facilities: \nirrigation systems, drainage facilities and conveyance channels, stormwater \ndetention areas, pumping stations, erosion control and soil stabilization  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.475  \n3/1/24 River Overlay Zones  \n \n475-19 \nfeatures, and pollution reduction facilities. Maintenance of drainage \nfacilities includes the dredging and channel cleaning of existing drainage \nfacilities and vegetative maintenance within the minimum floodway cross \nsection of drainageways where all spoils are placed outside environmental \nzones and the high sensitivity area; \n(6) Removing a nuisance tree listed on the Portland Plant List. When no other \ndevelopment is proposed, tree removal is subject to the tree permit \nrequirements of Title 11, Trees; \n(7) Planting of native vegetation listed on the Portland Plant List when planted \nwith hand-held equipment; \n(8) Public street and sidewalk improvements that do not enlarge the existing \ndisturbance area horizontally or vertically; and \n(9) Constructing paved parking lots and circulation areas in the transition area. \nb. Activities allowed with an archaeological resource recovery plan and MOU. For \nvillages; seasonal campsites; activity areas; and traditional, sacred, or cultural use \nsites, ground disturbing activities associated with uses otherwise permitted by \nthis Title are allowed if an archaeological resource recovery plan that meets the \nfollowing is submitted. Ground disturbing activities other than allowed by \nSubparagraph G.2.a. are prohibited within the archaeological resource and \ntransition area of a burial: \n(1) An archaeological resource recovery plan allows for the removal of \narchaeological materials following an archaeological evaluation, a \nconsultation process with appropriate tribes, and a private agreement \n(Memorandum of Understanding) between the applicant, property owner, \nSHPO and tribes. The required steps include: \n• Archaeological evaluation. A detailed archaeological evaluation must be \ncompleted. The evaluation must be conducted by a qualified archaeologist. \nThe evaluation must meet SHPO standards for archaeological resource \nrecovery projects.  \n• Consultation with appropriate tribes.  \n- The applicant must contact the appropriate tribes, by registered or certified \nmail, to request comments on archaeological survey results and \narchaeological resource recovery plan and offer a meeting. The tribes \nshould reply to the contact within 14 days and hold a meeting within 30 \ndays of the date of the initial contact. If the appropriate tribes do not reply \nwithin 30 days, the applicant may apply for a state archaeological permit \nand implement the terms of that permit without further delay. The tribes \nmay schedule the meeting with a tribal council, one of its committees, or \ndesignee. \n- The purpose of the meeting is to allow tribal representatives and the \napplicant to review archaeological survey results and discuss the \narchaeological resource recovery plan. More than one meeting may be held.   Chapter 33.475 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Overlay Zones 3/1/24 \n475-20 \n \n- After the meetings, and before applying for a building permit, the applicant \nmust send a letter to the appropriate tribes. The letter will explain any \nchanges in the project's design and archaeological resource recovery plan \nsince the date of the last meeting.  \n• Development of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The applicant \nmust develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the \napplicant, the property owner, SHPO and at least one appropriate tribe. The \nMOU must specify the care and disposition of any archaeological materials \nrecovered on the site. The MOU must also specify how the parties will \ncommunicate and how on-site monitoring will proceed during project \nconstruction.  \n• Archaeological resource recovery plans, letters to tribal governments and \nMemoranda of Understanding signed with SHPO and tribal governments \nmust be filed with the building permit. \n(2) For villages and traditional, sacred, or cultural use sites, an archaeological \nresource recovery plan is limited to the removal of archaeological materials \nnecessary to construct a paved parking lot or vehicle circulation area within \nan archaeological resource. The paved area must provide spill containment \nso that chemicals do not degrade the remaining archaeological resource. \n(3) For seasonal campsites and activity areas, an archaeological resource \nrecovery plan may remove some or all archaeological materials, as \nnegotiated with the appropriate tribes and specified in the archaeological \nresource recovery plan. \n3.

For planting areas over 600 square feet, at least two \ndifferent tree species and sizes, three different shrub species, and four \ndifferent groundcover species are used; \n(4) Plant size. Trees must be a minimum ½-inch caliper or bareroot unless they \nare oak or madrone, which may be one gallon size. No more than ten \npercent of the trees may be oak or madrone. Shrubs must be a minimum of \none gallon size or bareroot. All other species must be a minimum of four-\ninch pots or equivalent; and \n(5) The requirements of Section 33.248.090, Mitigation and Restoration \nPlanting must be met. \nc. Tree replacement. Trees that are 1.5 inches or greater in diameter that are \nremoved must be replaced based on Table 475-9: \n \nTable 475-9 \nTree Replacement in Hazardous Substance Cleanup Sites \nSize of tree to be removed (inches \nin diameter) \nOption A \n(no. of native trees to be \nplanted) \nOption B \n(combination of native trees and \nshrubs) \nAt least 1.5 and up to 6 2 Not applicable \nMore than 6 and up to 20 3 Not applicable \nMore than 20 and up to 25 5 3 trees and 6 shrubs \nMore than 25 and up to 30 7 5 trees and 9 shrubs \nMore than 30 10 7 trees and 12 shrubs \n(1) Size. The replacement trees must be a minimum ½-inch diameter or \nbareroot unless they are oak or madrone, which may be one gallon size.  Chapter 33.475 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Overlay Zones 3/1/24 \n475-44 \n \nShrubs must be a minimum of one gallon size or bareroot. All other species \nmust be a minimum of four-inch pots or equivalent. \n(2) Type. The replacement trees must be native trees selected from the \nPortland Plant List;  \n(3) Location. All replacement trees must be planted within the River \nEnvironmental overlay zone, within 50 feet of the River Environmental \noverlay zone, or within 50 feet of the top of bank of the Willamette River in \nthe River Environmental overlay zone. See Map 475-2. If the project site is \nlocated in the combined flood hazard area, the plantings must also be \nwithin the combined flood hazard area. The person conducting the cleanup \nmust own the property where the trees are planted or possess a legal \ninstrument, such as an easement or deed restriction, that is approved by \nthe City as sufficient to ensure the right to carry out, monitor, and maintain \nthe plantings; and  \n(4) Replacement trees can be counted toward meeting the requirements of \nsubsubparagraph F.1.b(2).  \nd. All vehicle areas and construction staging areas installed for purposes of \nconducting the removal and remediation actions must be removed from the \nRiver Environmental overlay zone when they are no longer necessary for remedy \nconstruction. All such areas must be removed by the time the project is complete \nand the areas must be replanted according to the standards of subparagraph \nF.1.b, above. \n2. The following regulations apply to the area between the top of bank and the ordinary \nhigh water mark: \na. When there is an alteration to the area between top of bank and the ordinary \nhigh water mark that is greater than 500 square feet or includes more than 50 \ncubic yards or excavation or fill, changes the ground contours, results in the \nremoval of buildings, requires engineering of the river bank or includes in-water \nwork, the following should be met (top of bank is shown on Map 475-2): \n(1) The area between the top of bank and the ordinary high water mark where \nthe alteration occurs must be designed using biotechnical techniques \nincluding soil bioengineering (top of bank is shown on Map 475-2). Figures \n475-7 and 475-8 show examples of biotechnical techniques. In addition to \nusing biotechnical techniques, the following requirements apply: \n• Rock armoring or other hard surface armoring methods must not be \nused between the top of bank and the Ordinary High Water Mark \nexcept as needed surrounding outfalls. This is not intended to preclude \nusing rock or other hard surface stabilization methods below the surface \nif necessary to contain hazardous substances or to preclude the use of \nrocks or gravel as part of the biotechnical technique;  \n• The bank must be sloped or terraced in a way that allows the \nestablishment and maintenance of vegetation as the primary soil \nstabilization method;   Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.475  \n3/1/24 River Overlay Zones  \n \n475-45 \n• If the site is currently used for public recreation, including access to a \nbeach or the river, the bank must be sloped or terraced in a way that \nallows for at least one public access way to the beach or river; \n• Large wood, including root wads, tree boles and logs, must be used to \nreduce localized erosion, improve bank stabilization, and improve \necological values and, if the site is currently used for public recreation, \nsupport continued use of beaches and the river; and \n• At least eighty percent of the area between the top of bank and the \nordinary high water mark that is being altered as a result of the remedy \nmust be planted with shrubs. At least one tree must be planted for \nevery 400 square feet of altered area. All of the area that is not planted \nwith shrubs or trees must be fully covered with ground cover plants. All \nplants must be selected from the Portland Plant List and should be \nappropriate for the conditions on the site. The requirements of Section \n33.248.090, Mitigation and Restoration Planting must be met. \n(2) If biotechnical techniques are not practicable, as described in 33.475.500.G, \nand rock armoring is used on the surface between the top of bank and the \nOrdinary High Water Mark, then the slope of the bank must be shallow \nenough to allow a combination of rock and vegetation. See Map 475-2. At a \nminimum, live native willow or dogwood stakes should be planted in \nadequate soil, in the interstices between the rocks at a ratio of three stakes \nfor every square yard of rock armoring. \nb. When there is a minor alteration of less than 500 square feet or less than 50 \ncubic yards of excavation or fill to the area between the top of bank and the \nordinary high water mark, the regulations of paragraph G.1, above apply. See \nMap 475-2. \n3. In the area that is riverward of the Ordinary High Water Mark, the following apply: \na. Avoid in-water permanent structures that will impact the navigation channel or \nwill preclude river-dependent or river-related development from accessing and \nutilizing the river for public recreation, transportation, tourism, or the transport, \ntransfer and conveyance of goods and materials to and from the upland site; \nb. Integrate large wood, or other natural wave deflection structures or techniques \nthat mimic the function of large wood, into the near-shore environment. Rock \narmoring, chemically treated wood, articulated block, and industrial debris is \ndiscouraged; \nc. If the area is a beach or is a shallow water depositional area, then the final design \nshould include all of the following:  \n(1) At least six inches depth of substrate that is ½-inch rounded gravel or \nsmaller in size should be placed over capping material; \n(2) The submerged slope should be no steeper than 1:7 (rise to run ratio); and \n(3)  Public access from major public trails or abutting upland sites to the river \nshould not be precluded.  Chapter 33.475 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Overlay Zones 3/1/24 \n475-46 \n \nd. If the area is not a beach or is not a shallow water depositional area, then the \nfinal substrate should be rounded rock no larger than 6 inches (D100=6”) with an \naverage gradation size of 3 inches (D50=3”). Angular rock is discouraged. \nG. Demonstration of Impracticability. A person conducting a cleanup may be exempted from \ncompliance with any requirement in this section if the person demonstrates that \ncompliance with the requirement is not capable of being done after taking into \nconsideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project remedial \npurposes. The person must still comply with that requirement to the extent practicable and \nremains subject to all other applicable requirements. To demonstrate impracticability the \napplicant must submit an engineering analysis, a cost schedule and any other information, \nsuch as desired future use of the site, that supports a demonstration that a requirement \ncannot be fully met. \nFigure 475-7 \nExample 1: Upland and In-Water Contamination Cleanup \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.475  \n3/1/24 River Overlay Zones  \n \n475-47 \nFigure 475-8 \nExample 2: In-Water Contamination Cleanup \n \n \n(Added by: Ord.

The standards for each subsection \nbelow apply only to areas with that designation in the respective plan. The resource is defined as the \nwidth of the right-of-way or top of bank to top of bank for scenic corridors. Setbacks are measured  Chapter 33.480 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nScenic Resource Zone 10/1/22 \n \n480-2 \nfrom the outer boundary of the right-of-way unless specified otherwise in the ESEE Analysis and as \nshown on the Official Zoning Maps. In some cases, more than one development standard applies. \nFor example, within a scenic corridor, a view corridor standard will apply where a specific view has \nbeen identified for protection. \nA. View Corridors. The following standards apply to development and vegetation within a \nview corridor. \n1. Purpose. The intent of the view corridor designation and standards is to establish \nmaximum heights within view corridors to protect views from designated viewpoints \nand to provide a location where the public can safely take in a significant view.  \n2. Standards.  \na. Height limit. All development within the designated view corridors are subject to \nthe height limits of the base zone, overlay zone, or plan district, except when a \nmore restrictive height limit is established by the view corridor. In those \ninstances, the view corridor height limit applies to both development and \nvegetation. Removal of trees or limbs necessary to maintain the view corridor is \nallowed. When no development is proposed, tree removal is subject to the \nrequirements of Title 11, Trees. Public safety facilities are exempt from this \nstandard.  \nb. Viewpoint standards. The following standards apply to the viewpoint portion of \nview corridors shown on a Map 480-1: \n(1) Construction of a viewpoint. Construction of a viewpoint that is at least 16 \nfeet in total area is required as follows: \n• When there is new development; \n• When exterior alterations to existing development are 35 percent or \ngreater of the assessed improvement value of the total improvements \non the site. \n(2) Viewpoint location.  \n• If the viewpoint is identified on a site that also has a major public trail \ndesignation, the viewpoint must be located adjacent to the major public \ntrail and must comply with the Use of Trail, Hours of Use, Trespass and \nTrail Maintenance and Liability sections of Chapter 33.272, Major Public \nTrails. \n• A viewpoint shown in a right-of-way must be located within or adjacent \nto the lanes of pedestrian or bicycle travel. \n(3) Viewpoint amenities. The viewpoint must include at least two of the \nfollowing amenities. The amenities must be located within the required \nviewpoint area: \n• A bench; \n• A light; \n• A sign with information about the view; or \n• A telescope directed at the focal features of the view.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.480 \n10/1/22 Scenic Resource Zone \n \n480-3 \nB. Scenic Corridors. The following standards apply to development and vegetation within a \nscenic corridor. \n1. Purpose. The scenic corridor designation is intended to preserve and enhance the \nscenic character along corridors, and where possible, scenic vistas from corridors. This \nis accomplished by limiting the length of buildings, preserving existing trees, providing \nadditional landscaping, preventing development in side setbacks, screening \nmechanical equipment, and restricting signs. Property owners and others are \nencouraged to make every effort to locate buildings, easements, parking strips, \nsidewalks, and vehicle areas to preserve the maximum number of trees. \n2. Standards. \na. Scenic corridor setback. A scenic corridor setback per Table 480-1 applies along \nstreet lot lines that abut the Scenic Corridor identified in the Scenic Resources \nProtection Plan. Development within an environmental overlay zone is exempt \nfrom this setback standard. \n \nTable 480-1 \nScenic Corridor Setback [1] \nZone Minimum Setback from Street Lot Line \nIR, CI 1’ per 2’ of building height, not less than 10’ \nRM2 3’ \nEG1, IH 5’ \nEG2, IG2 25’ \nAll other base zones 20’ \n[1] Larger minimum setbacks in overlay zone and plan district supersede this setback \nb. Side building setbacks. Buildings, garages, and covered accessory structures are \nnot allowed within the side building setbacks within the first 100 feet from the \ndesignated resource. \nc. Structure length. No more than 80 percent of the length of any site can be \noccupied by structures, excluding fences, as measured parallel to the scenic \ncorridor. This standard applies to an entire attached housing project rather than \nto individual units. \nd. Limiting blank facades. Long, blank facades create uninteresting elements along a \nscenic corridor. This standard applies to all portions of buildings within 100 feet \nof the designated resource. Residential structures are exempt from this standard. \nBlank facades must be mitigated for in at least one of the  \nfollowing ways:  \n(1) The maximum length of any building facade is 100 feet.  \n(2) Two rows of trees, one deciduous and one evergreen, must be planted on \n30-foot centers along the length of the building between the structure and \nthe protected resource.   Chapter 33.480 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nScenic Resource Zone 10/1/22 \n \n480-4 \n(3) Facades facing the scenic corridor must have a minimum of 40 percent of \nsurface area in glass. Mirrored glass with a reflectance greater than 20 \npercent is prohibited. \ne. Landscaping. The entire required scenic corridor setback must be landscaped to \nat least the L1 level unless the more stringent standards below or in other \nchapters of this Title apply. Up to 25 percent of the entire area of the scenic \ncorridor setback may be used for vehicle and pedestrian areas except that each \nlot is allowed at least a 9-foot wide driveway or parking area and a 6-foot wide \npedestrian area. Additionally, areas within the adjacent right of way must be \nlandscaped to standards approved by the City engineer. The required \nlandscaping in the setback and adjacent right of way must be provided at the \ntime of development, except as allowed in B.2.e(1) below. \n(1) When alterations are made to a site with an existing nonconforming use, \nallowed use, limited use, or conditional use, and the alterations are over the \nthreshold stated in 33.258.070.D.2.a, the site must be brought into \nconformance with the landscape standards above. The value of the \nalterations is based on the entire project, not individual building permits. \nThe cost of the upgrades required by this chapter may be counted toward \nthe cost of upgrades required by Subsection 33.258.070.D. However, the \nupgrades required by this chapter must be completed first. \n(2) Area of required improvements. Except as provided in 33.258.070.D.2.c(2), \nException for Sites With Ground Leases, required improvements must be \nmade to the entire site and adjacent right of way. If the ground lease is \nadjacent to a right of way within the scenic corridor, the upgrades required \nby this chapter also apply to the right of way adjacent to the ground lease. \n(3) Timing and cost of required improvements. The timing and cost of the \nrequired improvements is specified in 33.258.070.D.2.d. However, where \n33.258.070.D.2.d refers to the standards listed in 33.258.070.D.2.b, the \nlandscape standards above, are also included. \nf. Screening. All exterior garbage cans, garbage and recycling collection areas, and \nmechanical equipment (including heat pumps, air conditioners, emergency \ngenerators, and water pumps) must be screened from view or not visible from \nthe designated scenic corridor. Small rooftop mechanical equipment, including \nvents, need not be screened if the total area of such equipment does not exceed \n10 square feet  \nper structure. \ng. Fences and hedges. The total maximum height of fences, hedges, and berms \nwithin the scenic corridor setback, and when allowed in the adjacent right of way \nis 3-1/2 feet. This provision does not apply to any required screening  \nand buffering. \nh. Preservation of trees. This provision does not apply if the property is regulated \nby state statutes for forest management practices. All trees 6 or more inches in \ndiameter that are within the scenic corridor setback and right of way must be  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.480 \n10/1/22 Scenic Resource Zone \n \n480-5 \nretained unless removal conforms to one or more of the  \nfollowing standards: \n(1) The tree is located within a view corridor designated in the Scenic Resources \nProtection Plan (1991) or the Central City Scenic Resources Protection Plan \n(2017); \n(2) The tree is located within the footprint or within 10 feet of existing or \nproposed buildings and structures attached to buildings, such as decks, \nstairs, and carports, or within 10 feet of a proposed driveway;  \n(3) The tree is determined by an arborist to be dead, dying or dangerous; \n(4) The tree is on the Nuisance Plants List; \n(5) The tree must be removed due to installation, repair, or maintenance of \nwater, sewer, or stormwater services. For new installation of services, tree \nremoval allowed under this provision is limited to a single 10 foot wide \nutility corridor on each site; \n(6) The tree is within a proposed roadway or City-required construction \neasement, including areas devoted to curbs, parking strips or sidewalks, or \nvehicle areas; \n(7) The tree is within 20 feet of a Radio Frequency Transmission Facility \nantenna that is a public safety facility. The distance to the antenna is \nmeasured vertically and horizontally from the edge of the antenna. See \nFigure 480-1; or \n(8) The tree is at least 6 and up to 12 inches in diameter and does not meet any \nof the other standards of this subparagraph, but is replaced within the \nscenic corridor setback or adjacent right of way according to Table 480-2. \nReplacement plantings must meet Section 33.248.030, Plant Materials.

Tree removal without development. When no development is proposed, tree removal \nallowed by the standards of Subparagraph 33.480.040.B.2.h is subject to the tree permit \nrequirements of Title 11, Trees. \nB. Tree removal in development situations. When tree removal is proposed as part of \ndevelopment, the standards of Subparagraph 33.480.040.B.2.h apply in addition to the tree \npreservation standards of Title 11, Trees. \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.480 \n10/1/22 Scenic Resource Zone \n \n480-7 \nC. Trees that do not qualify for removal under Subparagraph 33.480.040.B.2.h may be \nremoved if approved through tree review as provided in Chapter 33.853, Tree Review. \nHowever, where the tree removal would require environmental review, only \nenvironmental review is required.  \n \n(Amended by: Ord.

An area may be unique based on natural, economic or historic attributes; be \nsubject to problems from rapid or severe transitions of land use; or contain public facilities which \nrequire specific land use regulations for their efficient operation. Plan districts provide a means to \nmodify zoning regulations for specific areas defined in special plans or studies. Each plan district has \nits own nontransferable set of regulations. This contrasts with base zone and overlay zone \nprovisions which are intended to be applicable in large areas or in more than one area. However, \nplan districts are not intended for small areas or individual properties. \n33.500.020 Establishment and Removal of Plan Districts \nA plan district may be established or removed as the result of an area planning study, reviewed \nthrough the legislative procedure. \n33.500.030 Scope of Plan Districts \nPlan district regulations are applied in conjunction with a base zone. The plan district provisions may \nmodify any portion of the regulations of the base zone, overlay zone, or other regulations of this \nTitle. The provisions may apply additional requirements or allow exceptions to general regulations. \n33.500.040 Relationship to Other Regulations \nWhen there is a conflict between the plan district regulations and base zone, overlay zone, or other \nregulations of this Title, the plan district regulations control. The specific regulations of the base \nzone, overlay zones, or other regulations of this Title apply unless the plan district provides other \nregulations for the same specific topic. \n33.500.050 Adoption Criteria \nA plan district may be established if all the following adoption criteria are met: \nA. The area proposed for the plan district has special characteristics or problems of a natural, \neconomic, historic, public facility, or transitional land use or development nature which are \nnot common to other areas of the City;  \nB.

The plan district’s \nprovisions are intended to provide additional opportunities for owner-occupied housing that can \nserve as less expensive alternatives to lower-density houses and that do not involve demolition of \nexisting sound housing. \n33.505.020 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to the Albina Community plan district. The boundaries of the \nplan district are shown on Map 505-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the Official \nZoning Maps.  \nDevelopment Standards \n33.505.230 Attached Houses on Vacant Lots in R5 Zoned Areas \nA. Purpose. The increased density permitted by this section encourages infill development in \nareas that are generally well served by existing public services. The increase allows the area \nto absorb additional growth without creating market pressure that might lead to the early \nremoval of existing sound housing. The increased density will lower the cost of housing \nwhile increasing opportunities for owner-occupied housing. Required design review of new \ndevelopment ensures that the new housing will make a positive contribution to the \nneighborhood’s character.  \nB. Attached houses. Attached houses are allowed in the R5 zone s stated in 33.110.265, \nResidential Infill Options.

Requirements for buildings along the Park Blocks and key focal \nintersections increases the activity level at those areas and provides an attractive  \npedestrian environment. \nAll uses and activities allowed within the plan district complement and serve ongoing airport \noperations and related airport service uses both within and outside plan district boundaries. These \nregulations also minimize or eliminate conflicts with airport operations and related uses.  \nThe plan district’s proximity to the Columbia Slough and the Columbia Slough Trail are recognized by \ninclusion of special development guidelines and bicycle-pedestrian connections. The plan district \nregulations also protect significant identified environmental and open space resources within the \nplan district consistent with the requirements of airport operations, while maintaining or enhancing \nthe capacity of public and private infrastructure within and serving the district.  \nThe plan district has two distinct areas: Subdistricts A and B: \nSubdistrict A is served with two light rail stations and will develop into a vibrant mixed-use \ncommercial area with strong design features, formal open space and multi-modal activity. Uses will \ninclude both larger format anchor tenants and small scale retailers that support office workers and \nregional shoppers. The mix of uses allowed in Subdistrict A is intended to create a critical economic \nmass of commercial and office development. \nThe remainder of the plan district, which is Subdistrict B, allows a wide range of employment \nopportunities. The primary development objective in this area is to encourage a wide range of \nindustrial and related uses, including services related to the Airport and other business and \nservice/employment opportunities compatible with existing and future airport operations and \nrelated uses in the area. The addition of airport-related service uses and activities as allowed uses \nserves and strengthens the Portland International Airport as the primary air transportation hub \nwithin the region. \n33.508.020 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to the Cascade Station/Portland International Center plan \ndistrict. The boundaries of the plan district are shown on Map 508-1 at the end of this chapter and on \nthe Official Zoning Maps. The two subdistricts (A and B) are also shown on Map 508-1.  \n33.508.030 Relationship to Other Regulations and Agencies \nThis chapter contains only the City’s regulations for the plan district. Activities which the City \nregulates through this chapter may also be regulated by other agencies. In particular, because the \nentire plan district is owned by the Port of Portland and was originally purchased for aviation use, the \nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) will review development proposals and amendments to this \nchapter to ensure that there will be no adverse impacts on airport operations. The regulations of this  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.508 \n6/30/23 Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District \n \n508-3 \nplan district have been designed to address FAA issues. City approval does not imply approval by \nother agencies. \n33.508.040 Special Definitions \nThese definitions are used only in the CS/PIC plan district.  \nLot. In this plan district, a lot includes both “lot” as defined in Chapter 33.910, Definitions, and “lease \nlot.” A lease lot is a parcel of land that is created as a result of a ground lease or sublease and which is \nclearly defined by a metes and bounds legal description and is a recorded document in the public \nrecord. References to lot lines, lot area, percentage of lot, and so on, are based on this definition of \nlot, but otherwise have the same meanings as in Chapter 33.910.  \nStreet. As defined in 33.910, but does not have to be a dedicated street or in a tract. Streets include \nthose streets shown in Figure 508-8, Street Requirements in Subdistrict A. \nStory. A single floor of activity—other than parking—in a building. A story is not defined by a \nparticular height.  \nUse Regulations \n33.508.120 Additional Allowed Uses \nA. Subdistrict A. The following additional uses are allowed in Subdistrict A, up to the \nmaximums allowed in Table 508-1: \n1. Office Uses; \n2. Major Event Entertainment, exhibition and meeting areas are allowed if built in \nconjunction with a hotel;  \n3. Retail Sales and Service \na. Hotels, Motels and Theatres \nb. Other Retail Sales And Service with the following limitations: \n(1) Generally, a single retail use may not occupy more than 60,000 square feet of \nfloor area per story, not including exterior display and storage; \n(2) Exception. Three buildings that do not meet the standard of (1) above are \nallowed as follows: \n• One building may contain a single retail use that occupies up to 90,000 \nsquare feet of floor area per story; \n• One building may contain a single retail use that occupies up to 185,000 \nsquare feet of floor area per story; and \n• One building may contain a single retail use that occupies up to 205,000 \nsquare feet of floor area per story; and \n4. Quick Vehicle Servicing. \nB. Subdistrict B. The following additional uses are allowed in Subdistrict B, up to the \nmaximums allowed in Table 508-1:  Chapter 33.508 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District 6/30/23 \n \n508-4 \n1. Office Uses; \n2.  Aviation and Surface Passenger Terminals, except parking for passengers; and \n3.  Car rental facilities including operations, service, storage and refueling facilities. \n33.508.130 Additional Prohibited Uses \nA. In plan district. The following uses are prohibited in the plan district: \n1. Household Living; \n2. Group Living; \n3. Self Service Storage; \n4. Commercial Outdoor Recreation; \n5. Community Service; \n6. Schools; \n7. Medical Centers; \n8. Religious Institutions; \n9. Vehicle Repair; and \n10. Detention Facilities. \nB. Subdistrict A. In Subdistrict A, the following uses are prohibited: \n1. Industrial Uses; \n2. Sale or lease of consumer vehicles, including passenger vehicles, motorcycles, light and \nmedium trucks, travel trailers, and other recreational vehicles. Offices for sale or lease \nof vehicles, where the vehicles are displayed or stored elsewhere are  \nallowed; and \n3. Commercial Parking. \nC. Subdistrict B. In Subdistrict B, the following uses are prohibited: \n1. Quick Vehicle Servicing; and \n2. Parking for passengers using Aviation and Surface Passenger Terminals. \n33.508.140 Use Regulations in the Park Blocks \nAll uses in the Park Blocks are subject to the use regulations of Chapter 33.100, Open Space Zone. See \nSection 33.508.215, Limitations on Development in the Park Blocks and Section 33.508.290, Open \nSpace Plan.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.508 \n6/30/23 Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District \n \n508-5 \nDevelopment and Design Standards \n33.508.200 Purpose \nThese development standards help to foster mixed-use transit-supportive development within the \nplan district, particularly near the two light rail stations while also encouraging the development of a \nretail center that includes both large- and small-format retail users. Light rail and transit access help \nto ensure that the plan district will serve as a hub of activity and an important international gateway \nto Portland. An urban character with a connected street pattern and building orientation standards \nthat orient development at the Park Blocks to pedestrians is also an important objective for the \ndistrict, particularly adjacent to the light rail stations. \nA significant constraint on development in this plan district is potential future traffic congestion on \nthe roads and interstate freeway surrounding the site, especially during the evening peak hour. To \naddress this constraint, and to take advantage of the site's two light rail stations and its high level of \nregional accessibility, the square footage limitations in this chapter are linked to development \ncapacity by square footage, and trip generation.  \n33.508.210 Prohibited Development in Subdistrict A \nThe following regulations apply to Subdistrict A: \nA. Exterior display and storage. Exterior display and exterior storage are prohibited. Outdoor \nseating for restaurants, delis and pedestrian-oriented accessory uses, such as flower, food or \ndrink stands, are exempt from this prohibition. \nB. Drive-through facilities. Drive-through facilities are prohibited within 200 feet of a light rail \nstation platform. Direct vehicular access to these facilities, including stacking lane entrances, \nfrom NE Cascades Parkway is prohibited.  \nC. Quick Vehicle Service. Quick Vehicle Service facilities are prohibited in the  \nfollowing locations: \n1. South of NE Cascades Parkway; and \n2. East of NE Mt. Hood Avenue. \n33.508.215 Limitations on Development in Park Blocks \nIn order to preserve the sense of openness and views within the Park Blocks, but still allow for small-\nscale structures such as restrooms, utility sheds, and other such structures, not more than 500 square \nfeet of total floor area may be built within the Park Blocks, shown on Figure 508-1.   Chapter 33.508 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District 6/30/23 \n \n508-6 \nFigure 508-1 \nPark Blocks and Build-To-Line Area \n \n33.508.220 Maximum Development/Transportation Capacity \nA. Purpose. Development in the plan district is organized around both transportation \nconstraints and opportunities: the capacity of the streets and freeways, and the two light \nrail stations within the plan district. The regulations of this section ensure that development \nwill not overburden infrastructure, while creating a market incentive to encourage transit \nuse and to choose a mix of complementary uses that maximize the potential for on-site local \ntrips and spread auto trips throughout the day. \n The regulations of this section limit the impact of the plan district’s development on the \nvehicular system by setting maximum allocations of allowable development in the district. \nThe limits are based on different types of allocations (for example, square footage, acres or \nhotel rooms). \nB. Limitations on the amount of development allowed. \n1. The regulations of this section address the amounts of each use that are allowed; all \nother regulations of this Title must also be met. \n2. Adjustments to the regulations in this section are prohibited. \n3. Development in the plan district is allowed as follows: \na. Proposals that are within the limits of Table 508-1 are allowed. No transportation \nanalyses are required for development within the limits of  \nTable 508-1;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.508 \n6/30/23 Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District \n \n508-7 \nb. Trades from one category to another are allowed as specified in  \nTable 508-1; \nc. Applicants may request approval of a proposal that exceeds the limits of Table \n508-1 by submitting a Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA). See Subsection C. \n4. As building permits are issued and when conversions are made as specified in Table \n508-1, PP&D will maintain records as to the amounts remaining in each use category. \n5. Transferring trips or allocations between Subdistrict A and B is prohibited. \nC. Cascade Station/Portland International Center Transportation Impact Analysis Review. An \napplicant may propose development that exceeds the allocation limits of Table 508-1 \nthrough a land use review that is based on a Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA). This \napproach allows an applicant more flexibility but is more complex to use. In addition to the \napplication requirements of Section 33.730.060, the applicant must prepare a TIA that \nincludes the elements and analysis listed in 33.852.105. The TIA may be used to exceed the \nmaximum allocation limits in Table 508-1 or to establish lower trip generation rates. The TIA \nmay not be used to exceed the total trips in Table 508-1. \n \n \nTable 508-1 \nUse Allocations and Respective Allowable Conversion Relationships \n \nUse \nBase Use \nAllocations \nAllowed \nMinimum \nAllocations  \nAfter Trades \n \nAllowable Trades [3] \nSubdistrict A \nOffice, Meeting Rooms and \nExhibition Areas greater than 20,000 \nsquare feet [1], Daycare, Colleges \n \n1,115,000 sq. ft. \n \n557,500 sq. ft. \n \n370 sq. ft. office to 1 hotel room \nHotel, Meeting Rooms and \nExhibition Areas less than 20,000 \nsquare feet [1] \n250 rooms 250 rooms 1 hotel room to 370 sq. ft. office \nQuick Vehicle Servicing [2] 1 facility, up to \n12 fueling \npositions \nNone 1 facility to 72,000 sq. ft. office \n[4] \nRetail Sales And Service, including \nRestaurants \n \n807,500 sq. ft. \n \n403,750 sq. ft. \n900 sq. ft. retail to 700 sq. ft. \noffice \n470 sq. ft. retail to 1 hotel room \nTotal Trips Subdistrict A: 2,085 \n \nSubdistrict B \nOffice, Meeting Rooms and \nExhibition Areas greater than 20,000 \nsquare feet [1], Daycare, Colleges \n \n304,000 sq. ft. \n \n152,000 sq. ft. \n100 sq. ft. office to 400 sq. ft. \nindustrial \n370 sq. ft. office to 1 hotel room \nHotel, Meeting Rooms and \nExhibition Areas less than 20,000 \nsquare feet [1] \n \n260 rooms \n \n130 rooms \n1 hotel room to 370 sq. ft. office \n1 hotel room to 1,500 sq. ft. \nindustrial \nRetail Sales And Service, including \nRestaurants \n30,000 sq. ft. 15,000 sq. ft. 900 sq. ft. retail to 700 sq. ft. \noffice \n470 sq. ft. retail to 1 hotel room  Chapter 33.508 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District 6/30/23 \n \n508-8 \nTable 508-1 \nUse Allocations and Respective Allowable Conversion Relationships \n \nUse \nBase Use \nAllocations \nAllowed \nMinimum \nAllocations  \nAfter Trades \n \nAllowable Trades [3] \nIndustrial Uses 2,100,000 sq. ft. 1,050,000 sq. \nft. \n400 sq. ft. industrial to 100 sq. ft. \noffice \n1,500 sq. ft. industrial to 1 hotel \nroom \nCar Rental Facilities (including \noperations, service, storage and \nrefueling facilities), Aviation and \nSurface Passenger Terminals, \nCommercial Parking \n100 acres (No \nmaximum limit \non building \nsquare footage) \n \n \nNone \n \n \nNone \nTotal Trips Subdistrict B: 1,426 \n \nTotal Trips Subdistricts A and B: 3,511 \nNotes: \n[1] Conference facilities, such as exhibition and meeting areas, are classified as Major Event Entertainment \nUses. In this plan district, they are allowed only if built in conjunction with a hotel (see 33.508.120.A). If the \nnet building area devoted to these uses is less than 20,000 square feet, it is considered accessory to the \nhotel, and is regulated by the plan district as a hotel, so there is no maximum square footage. If, however, \nthe net building area is 20,000 square feet or more, it is regulated the same as Office Uses, and is subject to \nthe same maximum square footage as office uses. \n[2] Fueling positions are the maximum number of vehicles that can be fueled simultaneously. Therefore, 12 \nfueling positions would allow 12 cars to fuel at one time. For example, if each pump had two fueling \nareas/nozzles (one each side), there could be up to 6 pumps. \n[3] Allowable trades read from left to right only. For example, Subdistrict A Retail can be traded to \nSubdistrict A Office at a ratio of 900 sq. ft. of retail to 700 sq. ft. of office. However, Subdistrict A Office \ncannot be traded to Subdistrict A Retail as there is no such ratio listed. Trades down to the minimums are \nallowed. Trades below the minimums are prohibited. \n[4] Quick Vehicle Service is not divisible; the facility may be converted to 72,000 sq. ft. of office, but fractions \n(such as trading 6 fueling positions to 36,000 sq. ft. of office) are not allowed. \n33.508.230 Development and Design Standards in Subdistrict A \nA. Purpose. These provisions ensure that the location and scale of buildings, parking and \ncirculation areas within Subdistrict A provide a convenient and attractive environment for \npedestrians, transit users, customers and employees that come to the area. The focus for \ndesign in Subdistrict A includes the Cascades Parkway and Mt. Hood Avenue light rail station \nareas and the Park Blocks. Transit-supportive building and site design and pedestrian \nlinkages are sought near the station areas as a means to link the station areas and \ndevelopment elsewhere in the subdistrict. The light rail stations, Park Blocks and retail, \noffice, and entertainment uses work together to create a unique place. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of Subsection C apply to all development in \nSubdistrict A of the plan district. The regulations of Subsection D apply to development in \nthe Build-To Line Area shown on Figure 508-1. The regulations of Subsection E apply to \ndevelopment in the Cascades Parkway Station Area shown on Figure 508-4. The regulations \nof Subsection F apply to development in the Mt. Hood Avenue Station Area shown on Figure \n508-5.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.508 \n6/30/23 Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District \n \n508-9 \nC. All areas of Subdistrict A. All development in Subdistrict A of the plan district must meet the \nfollowing: \n1. Building height.  \na. Where all of the floor area is in Office uses, or where there is more than one use \ncategory in the building, the building must have at least two stories and be at least \n25 feet high; \nb. Where all of the floor area is in a single use other than Office, Quick Vehicle \nService or Retail Sales And Service uses, the building must be at least 25  \nfeet high; \nc. Where all of the floor area is in Retail Sales And Service uses, the following must \nbe met: \n(1) Buildings at the corners of NE Mt. St. Helens and the northern NE Cascades \nParkway must be at least 25 feet height. See Figure 508-4;  \n(2) Buildings at all other locations must be at least 18 feet high.  \n2. Ground Floor Windows.  \na. Purpose. Blank walls on the ground level of buildings are limited in order to: \n• Provide a pleasant, rich, and diverse pedestrian experience by connecting \nactivities occurring within a structure to adjacent sidewalk areas; \n• Encourage continuity of retail and service uses;  \n• Encourage surveillance opportunities by restricting fortress-like facades at \nstreet level; and  \n• Avoid a monotonous pedestrian environment.  \nb. Required amount of window area. This standard must be met on street facing \nfacades on the ground level that are 50 feet or closer to the curb of a street. \nWindows must be at least 40 percent of the length and 20 percent of the ground \nlevel wall area. Ground level walls include all exterior wall areas up to 9 feet \nabove the finished grade.  \nc. Qualifying window features.  \n(1) Generally. Required window areas must be either windows that allow views \ninto working areas or lobbies, pedestrian entrances, or display windows set \ninto the wall. Display cases attached to the outside wall do not qualify. The \nbottom of the windows must be no more than 3 feet above the adjacent \nexterior grade.  \n(2) Hotel uses. Hotel room windows may be used to meet this standard along \nprivate streets. The bottom of the windows must be no more than 3 feet \nabove the adjacent exterior grade.  \n \n \n  Chapter 33.508 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District 6/30/23 \n \n508-10 \nd. Exceptions.  \n(1) Where all of the floor area is in Quick Vehicle Service uses or Convention and \nConference Facilities, the regulations of this section do not have to  \nbe met; \n(2) Buildings with more than 60,000 square feet of net building area in a single \nRetail Sales And Service use do not have to meet the regulations of this  \nsection; and \n(3) Street facing facades 50 feet or closer to the NE Mt. Hood Avenue ramp, NE \nAirport Way, and the I-205 right-of-way are not subject to the regulations of \nthis section. \n3. Awning at main entrance. There must be an awning or other projection from the \nbuilding at the main entrance to provide weather protection. The awning or other \nprojection must: \na. Cover at least 48 square feet; \nb. Be at least 6 feet back from the curb of a street; and \nc. Project at least 6 feet out from the building face. If the sidewalk is too narrow to \nallow 6 feet out from the building face and 6 feet back from the curb, then the \nawning or other projection must project to a line 6 feet back from the curb. \n Other awnings or projections are encouraged, but are not required to meet  \nthis standard.  \n4. Landscaping must meet the standards of Section 33.565.220, Landscaping, that apply in \nthe Airport Subdistrict. \nD. Build-To Line Area. Buildings on lots with frontage on public or private streets within the \nBuild-To Line Area (BTLA) shown on Figure 508-1 must meet the regulations of this \nsubsection. However, sites in Subarea 5 in Figure 508-8 are exempt from these regulations. \n1. Building location.  \na. Purpose. These standards require buildings to be built around the Park Blocks. The \nPark Blocks and the adjacent Build-To-Line Area create focal points of the plan \ndistrict, and the intent is to focus transit oriented development in these areas. In \naddition, these regulations foster an active pedestrian environment within the \nfirst 75 feet from NE Cascades Parkway and the portion of NE Mt. St. Helens \nAvenue north of the Park Blocks where buildings are located close to the street \nand there are limited gaps between buildings.  \nb. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this paragraph apply to \ndevelopment on lots where the frontage within the Build-To Line Area is more \nthan 62 feet long.  \n \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.508 \n6/30/23 Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District \n \n508-11 \nc. Setbacks.  \n(1) Minimum setback. The minimum building setback is 2 feet. The setback area \nmust be paved with sidewalk materials to create an expanded  \nsidewalk area; \n(2) Maximum setback. For at least 80 percent of the length of the street lot line, \nthere must be a building wall or pedestrian amenity within 6 feet of the front \nlot line. Where a pedestrian amenity is used to meet this standard, areas up \nto 500 square feet or 20 feet deep may be used. Larger pedestrian amenities \nare allowed, but may not be used to meet this standard. See Figure 508-2. \n(3) Corner lots. Except as specified in D.1.c(4), buildings with more than one \nstreet lot line frontage must meet the standards of D.1.c(1) and (2) on all \nstreet lot lines. \n(4) Exception. Buildings with street lot line frontage on both NE Cascades \nParkway and a Type B street must meet the standards of D.1.c(1) and (2) on \nthe NE Cascades Parkway street lot line frontage, but do not have to meet \nthe standards on the Type B street lot line frontage. However, surface \nparking is not allowed within 50 feet of the street lot line frontage on the \nType B street within the BTLA. See Figure 508-3. \nFigure 508-2 \nBuild-To-Line Setback Illustration \n  Chapter 33.508 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District 6/30/23 \n \n508-12 \nFigure 508-3 \nBuild-To-Line Setback Exception Illustration \n \n2. Location of parking.  \na. Structured parking. If any portion of a building is within the Build-To Line Area, \nand there is parking on the ground floor, the following must be met: \n(1) Purpose. These standards ensure that the ground level of buildings in the \nBuild-To Line Area contain active uses to support the pedestrian character of \nthe area. \n(2) The parking may not be in the portion of the building closest to the street lot \nline; there must be a use other than parking between the parking and the \nstreet lot line. \n(3) On corner lots, the parking may not be in the portion of the building closest \nto either street lot line. There must be a use other than parking between the \nparking and the both street lot lines. \nb. Surface parking.  \n(1) Required setback. Surface parking area must be set back at least 12 feet from \nstreet lot lines. Parking lot landscaping may be located within 12 feet of \nstreet lot lines. \n(2) Frontage limitation. Where surface parking areas are adjacent to a street lot \nline, the following must be met. Surface parking is considered to be adjacent \nto a street lot line, regardless of setback, when there is no building or \npedestrian plaza between the street lot line and the parking area: \n• No more than 62 feet of the frontage, measured along the street lot line, \nmay be used for surface parking areas; and \n• The 62 feet of frontage includes adjacent surface parking areas, \ndriveways, and other areas for vehicle parking and maneuvering, where  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.508 \n6/30/23 Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District \n \n508-13 \nthose areas also are adjacent to the street lot line. These areas must be \nseparated by buildings.  \n3. Building entrances. \na. Single tenant buildings. There must be at least one main entrance that meets the \nstandards of D.3.c. \nb. Multi-tenant buildings. Multi-tenant buildings must meet the following: \n(1) Where there is a lobby or principal interior ground level circulation space, the \nmain entrance that provides access to the lobby or circulation space must \nmeet the standards of D.3.c. \n(2) Where there is not a lobby or principal interior ground level circulation \nspace, each tenant space that is in the portion of the building within 10 feet \nof a street lot line must have at least one main entrance that meets the \nstandards of D.3.c. \nc. Standards. The main entrance must: \n(1) Face the street lot line; \n(2) Be at an angle of up to 45 degrees from the street lot line street, measured \nfrom the street lot line, as shown in Figure 508-4; or \n(3) Face a pedestrian amenity or plaza within the Build-To-Line Area. \n(4) If there is more than one street frontage, the main entrance must face \nstreets in the following order of priority, from highest to lowest: \n• NE Cascades Parkway \n• Type A streets \n• Type B streets \n• Type C streets \n• Type D streets \nd.

Chapter 33.508 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District 6/30/23 \n \n508-14 \nFigure 508-4 \nBuilding Entrances \n \nE. Within Cascades Station Area. All development within the Cascades Station Area, shown on \nFigure 508-5, must meet the regulations of this subsection.  \n1. Purpose. The Cascades Station Area is a key area of the plan district, because of the \nlocation of the eastern light rail station which provides the gateway into the site for \nlight rail transit riders, and its alignment with NE Mt. St. Helens Avenue through the \nPark Blocks. The Cascades Station Area includes a portion of the Park Blocks system and \nemphasizes the connection between the light rail transit station and the portion of NE \nMt. St. Helens Avenue north of the Park Blocks. \n A pedestrian oriented plaza south of the light rail transit station makes the Cascades \nlight rail station a focal point of the area with easy access to and from the activities and \nuses and the light rail station, as illustrated in Figure 508-5. The central plaza within the \n“Y” of NE Mt. St. Helens Avenue south of the station platform may include a limited \namount of area for vehicle area or parking area to serve retail uses in  \nthe station. \n Pedestrian path location and design should provide north-south and east-west \nconnectivity to and from the light rail station and the adjacent developments, as \nillustrated in Figure 508-5. \n2. Pedestrian connections. Pedestrian connections from the east and west ends of the \nlight rail platform must provide for pedestrian movements to the Park Block pedestrian \nnetwork, to the lots to the south, and towards the portion of NE Mt. St. Helens Avenue \nnorth of the Park Blocks. The connections must be in the general location shown on \nFigure 508-4.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.508 \n6/30/23 Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District \n \n508-15 \n3. Sidewalks. Sidewalks within 200 feet of the light rail platform must be at least 12  \nfeet wide.  \n4. Parking limitations. In order to create a pedestrian-friendly area around the light rail \nstation, parking is not allowed between buildings and NE Mt. St. Helens Avenue. \nHowever, if a building is set back at least 200 feet from NE Mt. St. Helens Avenue, \nparking is allowed between that building and NE Mt. St. Helens Avenue. \n5. Entrances. \na. Portions of a building that are within 200 feet from NE Mt. St. Helens Avenue \nmust have an entrance facing Mt. St. Helens Avenue or be within 45 degrees of \nthe street. \nb. Buildings at the corner of NE Mt. St. Helens Avenue and the northern NE Cascades \nParkway must have the main entrances facing the corner of NE Mt. St. Helens \nAvenue and NE Cascades Parkway. \nF. Within Mt. Hood Station Area. All development within the Mt. Hood Station Area, shown \non Figure 508-6, must meet the regulations of this subsection. \n1. Purpose. The Mt. Hood Station Area is a key area of the plan district, because the \nlocation of the western light rail station provides the gateway into the site for light rail \ntransit riders arriving from the airport. It is not immediately adjacent to the Park Blocks \nand the lot and roadway configuration provides development challenges due to acute \nangles and the location of the light rail tracks through this area. Nevertheless, the light \nrail station should have development and uses that are oriented towards it and the \ntransit riders who will embark and disembark from this area. Pedestrian plaza and path \nlocation and design should provide connectivity to adjacent areas, as illustrated in \nFigure 508-6. \n2. Pedestrian connection. Pedestrian connections from the light rail platform must \nprovide for pedestrian movements to the Park Block pedestrian network, and to the \nlots to the south across NE Cascades Parkway. The connections must be in the general \nlocation shown on Figure 508-6. \n3. Sidewalks. Sidewalks within 200 feet of the light rail platform must be at least 12  \nfeet wide. \n4. Parking limitations. In order to create a pedestrian-friendly area around the light rail \nstation, parking is not allowed between buildings and NE Cascades Parkway. However, \nif a building is set back at least 200 feet from NE Cascades Parkway, parking is allowed \nbetween that building and NE Cascades Parkway. This standard does not apply to the \ntriangular area shown on Figure 508-6. \n5. Entrances. Portions of a building that are within 200 feet from NE Cascades Parkway \nmust have an entrance facing NE Cascades Parkway or be within 45 degrees of  \nthe street.  Chapter 33.508 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District 6/30/23 \n \n508-16 \nFigure 508-5 \nCascades Stations Area \n \n33.508.240 Development and Design Standards in Subdistrict B \nThe regulations of this section apply to all development in Subdistrict B of the plan district.  \nA. Setbacks. There are no minimum setbacks.  \nB. Awning at main entrance. There must be an awning or other projection from the building at \nthe main entrance to provide weather protection. The awning or other projection must: \n1. Cover at least 48 square feet; \n2. Be at least 6 feet back from the curb; and \n3. Project at least 6 feet out from the building face. If the sidewalk is too narrow to allow \nboth this provision and B.2 to be met, the awning or other projection must project to a \nline 6 feet back from the curb.  \nOther awnings or projections are encouraged, but are not required to meet this standard.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.508 \n6/30/23 Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District \n \n508-17 \nFigure 508-6 \nMt. Hood Station Area \n \nC. Landscaping. Landscaping must meet the standards of Section 33.565.220, Landscaping, \nthat apply in the Airport Subdistrict. \n33.508.260 Parking  \nA. Purpose. In Subdistrict A, on-street parking is encouraged on both public and private streets, \nto reduce the size of parking lots and to provide a buffer between pedestrians and moving \ncars. Accessory parking is allowed to be located throughout Subdistrict A to encourage \nshared parking. Shared parking is encouraged to promote an active, mixed-use development \nand reduce the total number of off-street parking spaces required. Adjacent uses with \ndifferent peak parking utilization periods can share parking areas and allow more efficient \nuse of parking areas throughout the day.  \nB. Maximum allowed parking. \n1. Subdistrict A. The following regulations apply in Subdistrict A: \na. Structured parking. The maximum allowed parking for parking in structures is in \nChapter 33.266, Parking, Loading, and Transportation and Parking Demand \nManagement.  \nb. Surface parking.  \n(1) Generally, the maximum allowed parking for surface parking is in Chapter \n33.266 Parking, Loading, and Transportation and Parking Demand \nManagement. \n(2) Exception. There is no maximum for parking on surface lots for fleet, carpool, \nand rental car parking.  \n(3) Adjustments. Where there is a single retail use that occupies more than \n60,000 square feet of floor area in a single story, adjustments to maximum \nallowed parking ratios are prohibited. Hotels, motels, restaurants and \ntheaters are not subject to this limitation. \n2. Subdistrict B. The maximum parking allowed in Subdistrict B is in Chapter 33.266, \nParking, Loading, and Transportation and Parking Demand Management.  Chapter 33.508 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District 6/30/23 \n \n508-18 \nC. Large parking areas in Subdistrict A. Parking areas in Subdistrict A are exempt from the \ninternal accessway requirements of 33.266.130.C.4.b and 33.266.130.F.5-6. \nD. Location of parking. Accessory Parking for uses in Subdistrict A may be located on any lot in \nSubdistrict A. \n33.508.267 Signs \nThe sign regulations are stated in Title 32, Signs and Related Regulations. \n33.508.270 Sumps, Septic Tanks, and On-Site Disposal Systems  \nNew sumps, septic tanks, cesspools, and other on-site disposal systems for sanitary or industrial are \nprohibited. All on-site storm water must be disposed of into a system approved by the Bureau of \nEnvironmental Services. \nFigure 508-7 \nBasic Public Infrastructure \n \n \n \n33.508.280 Street Requirements in Subdistrict A  \nThese requirements help create a clear and efficient street system connecting to the Park Blocks, \nproviding the feel of an urban environment and encouraging pedestrian activity by breaking up the \nlong distances along the Park Blocks between the light rail stations. Figure 508-8 shows the Street \nRequirements in Subdistrict A and the five subareas within it. \nThe requirements of this section apply to all streets in Subdistrict A.  \nA. Public streets. Public streets are shown on Figure 508-7. Some of these streets have been \ncompleted and dedicated. \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.508 \n6/30/23 Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District \n \n508-19 \nB. Private streets. \n1. Generally. \na. The approximate locations for private streets are shown in the Street Plan, Figure \n508-8; \nb. The Portland Bureau of Transportation and PP&D determine the extent and timing \nof street improvements; \nc. Buildings and other improvements must be located so that they do not preclude \ncreation of streets in conformance with this section; and \nd. All measurements in this section are from centerline to centerline, unless \nspecified otherwise. \n2. In Subareas 1 and 5: \na. Streets connecting to NE Cascades Parkway must line up with the existing Park \nBlock intersections. However, where those existing Park Block intersections are at \nleast 350 feet apart, a connecting street may be built mid-block and must be at \nleast 100 feet from an existing Park Block intersection; and \nb. Streets not connecting to NE Cascades Parkway must be located within 50 feet of \nthe locations shown in Figure 508-8. \n3. In Subarea 2, streets must be located within 150 feet of the locations shown in  \nFigure 508-8. \n4. In Subarea 3: \na. At least five Type B streets must connect NE Cascades Parkway to the street that \nis south of NE Cascades Parkway and runs east-west. These streets can be no \nmore than 530 feet apart as measured from edge of street to edge of street; \n(1) At least three of these streets must line up with the existing Park Block \nintersections; and \n(2) Streets that do not line up with the existing Park Block intersections must be \nat least 100 feet from such an intersection. \nb. Streets not connecting to NE Cascades Parkway must be located within 150 feet of \nthe locations shown in Figure 508-8, and in no case closer than 100 feet to NE \nCascades Parkway. \n5.

The entry must have the \nsame appearance and materials as the public street, including curb returns, except that  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.508 \n6/30/23 Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District \n \n508-23 \nthe entry itself must be of a different material. The material, which must be concrete or \nanother durable material that contrasts with asphaltic concrete paving, must be placed \nin the approximate location of the pedestrian crosswalk. On street entries within 200 \nfeet of a light rail station, the paving material used at the entry must continue the same \npaving material and texture found within the NE Cascades Parkway or Mt. Hood \nAvenue Station area. \n3. Driveways. Driveways are not allowed to intersect NE Cascades Parkway except for one \ntruck access in Subarea 1. See Figure 508-1. \n33.508.290 Open Space Plan \nA. Park Blocks.  \n1. Purpose. The Park Blocks are both the primary open space of the plan district and the \nfocus of development in Subdistrict A. These open spaces will provide visitors and \nemployees with leisure and recreational opportunities as well as a pleasant visual \nenvironment. The Park Blocks open the site to views of Mt. Hood and link the two \ntransit station areas with a grand urban space in the tradition of Portland’s downtown \nPark Blocks. The location of the Cascade Station Park Blocks is shown on Figure 508-1.  \n2. Uses and development. Uses and development in the Park Blocks are regulated by \nSection 33.508.140, Use Regulations in the Park Blocks, and Section 33.508.215, \nLimitations on Development. \nB. Pedestrian and bicycle circulation system.  \n1. Purpose. The Columbia Slough Trail, shown on Figure 508-13, is a significant open \nspace resource as well as a means of pedestrian and bicycle access. Trails in this area \nrun along the Columbia Slough and provide an inviting environment to run, walk, or \nbike. Bike routes (bike lanes and signed routes) must work in an integrated way with \nthis existing resource to form an extended network of trails.  \n2. Public trail requirements. All sites designated on Figure 508-13 as off-road public trails \nmust meet the requirements of this subsection and Chapter 33.272. Figure 508-13 \nillustrates the general location of the CS/PIC Bicycle and Pedestrian system, which \nprovides for additional off-road trails and connections to the Columbia Slough Trail. \n If the trail is located within an Environmental Overlay zone, the trail must also comply \nwith the requirements in Sections 33.508.300 through .340. \na. Trail requirement. Prior to occupancy of any new building on a lot containing a \ntrail designation, the owner must make the full trail improvement on that lot. The \ntrail location and construction specifications must be shown on the site plans \nwhen a building permit is requested. \nb. Trail and easement location. \n(1) In Environmental Overlay Zones the following must be met: \n• If a trail or easement exist on an adjacent site, the trail and easement \nmust connect to them;  Chapter 33.508 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District 6/30/23 \n \n508-24 \n• If there is not an easement or trail on an adjacent site, the easement \nmust be located in the outer 25 feet of the environmental zone. The trail \nimprovement must be at least 5 feet from the outer edge of the \nenvironmental zone.  \n(2) Outside of Environmental Overlay Zones the trail route must be as generally \nshown on Figure 508-13. \n33.508.295 Archaeological Resource Protection \nArchaeological evidence has confirmed that American Indians used the plan district area prior to \nentry of EuroAmericans to the Portland area. Before 1999 this plan district was part of the Columbia \nSouth Shore plan district, and all confirmation testing required by that plan district was completed \nbefore this plan district was created. As a result, there are no regulations in this plan district that \nrelate to protection of archaeological resources.  \nAlthough the zoning code does not address new discoveries of archaeological resources found during \nproject construction, applicants should be aware of state and federal regulations that apply to such \ndiscoveries. \nFigure 508-13 \nBicycle and Pedestrian Circulation Plan \n \n \nEnvironmental Overlay Zones \n33.508.300 Purpose  \nThe purposes of the environmental code in the Cascade Station/Portland International Center \n(CS/PIC) Plan District in conjunction with the standards of Chapter 33.430 are to: \n• Protect inventoried significant natural resources and their functional values specific to the \nCS/PIC Plan District, as identified in the Comprehensive Plan;   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.508 \n6/30/23 Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District \n \n508-25 \n• Address activities required to manage Port facilities, drainageways and wildlife around the \nPortland International Airport airfield for public and avian safety;  \n• Address resource mitigation and enhancement opportunities consistent with managing \nwildlife and vegetation on and around the airfield for public safety;  \n• Encourage coordination between City, county, regional, state, and federal agencies \nconcerned with airport safety and natural resources; and \n• Protect inventoried significant archaeological resources where those resources overlap with \nan environmental protection zone or environmental conservation zone. \n33.508.310 Relationship to Other Environmental Regulations \nThe regulations of Sections 33.508.300 through 33.508.397 are supplemental to or supersede the \nregulations of Chapter 33.430. Whenever a provision of this plan district conflicts with Chapter \n33.430, the plan district provision supersedes.  \nThe following sections supersede or supplement the regulations of Chapter 33.430: \n• Exemptions in Section 33.508.340 supplement exemptions in Section 33.430.080; \n• Standards in Section 33.508.350 supplement or supersede standards in sections in \n33.430.140 through .190; \n• When wildlife hazard management is proposed and an environmental review is required the \nprocedure type specified in Subsection 33.508.360.A supersedes the procedure type \nspecified in Section 33.430.230; \n• When wildlife hazard management is proposed and an environmental review is required, the \nrequirements of Subsection 33.508.360.B supersede the requirements of Subsection \n33.430.240;  \n• When wildlife hazard management is proposed and an environmental review is required, the \napproval criteria of Subsection 33.508.360.C supersede the approval criteria of Subsections \n33.430.250.E and F; \n• The environmental Plan Check notice and review procedures of Sections 33.508.392 through \n.397 supersede the notice and review procedures of Section 33.430.410 through .430. \nThis chapter contains only the City’s environmental regulations.

The regulations address the \nunique role the Central City plays as the region’s premier center for jobs, health and human services, \ntourism, entertainment and urban living. The regulations encourage a high-density urban area with \na broad mix of commercial, residential, industrial and institutional uses, and foster transit-\nsupportive development, pedestrian and bicycle-friendly streets, a vibrant public realm and a \nhealthy urban river. \n33.510.020 Where the Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to the Central City plan district. The boundaries of the plan \ndistrict and its subdistricts are shown on Map 510-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the Official \nZoning Maps. For other regulations, in cases of conflict the most restrictive regulation controls. The  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.510 \n1/1/25 Central City Plan District \n \n510-3 \ninformation depicted on Maps 510-1 through 510-23 is part of the plan district regulations and is \nsubject to the same amendment procedures as amendments to the text of this chapter. \n33.510.030 Application of Regulations Along Proposed Rights-of-Way and Accessways \nWhere Maps 510-1 through 510-23 identify a right-of-way as a “proposed right-of-way” or \n“proposed accessway,” the location of the right-of-way or accessway on the map represents only a \nconceptual location. When dedicated or improved, the location of the right-of-way or accessway \nmay vary from the conceptual location shown on these maps. Regulations of this chapter that are \nbased on the location of a proposed right-of-way or accessway apply as follows: \nA. If the right-of-way or accessway has been improved or dedicated, the regulation applies \nbased on the actual location of the right-of-way, tract, or easement. \nB. If the right-of-way or accessway has not been improved or dedicated, the regulation \napplies based on the location of the facility as shown on the street plan for the area that \nhas been accepted by City Council. The street plan is maintained by the Portland Bureau of \nTransportation and is documented in the Transportation Element of Portland’s \nComprehensive Plan. \nUse Regulations \n33.510.100 Vehicle Repair and Vehicle Sales or Leasing  \nA. Vehicle Repair uses are prohibited in the areas shown on Map 510-17.  \nB.

Offices for the sale or leasing of consumer vehicles where the vehicles are displayed or \nstored elsewhere are allowed; and  \n2. The temporary sale or leasing of consumer vehicles is allowed for up to 14 consecutive \ndays. The time between temporary sales or leasing events must be 4 times as long as \nthe duration of the last event. \n33.510.110 Mixed Use Waterfront Development \nA. Purpose. The Central City 2035 Plan area fronts on portions of the working harbor. The \nworking harbor is the area downstream from the Broadway Bridge. Sites developed for \nmixed use projects in residential zones along the working harbor will better implement the \nCentral City 2035 Plan, Willamette Greenway Plan, Lower Willamette River Management \nPlan, and Comprehensive Plan if compatible river dependent industrial activities are \nallowed as part of mixed use projects. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to portions of sites in \nthe RX zone that are next to the Willamette River, and are downstream from the  \nBroadway Bridge. \nC. Additional uses allowed. The following uses are allowed in the nonresidential portion of a \nmixed use development:  Chapter 33.510 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Plan District 1/1/25 \n510-4 \n1. Passenger ship docking facilities and accessory customs and cargo handling  \nfacilities; and  \n2. Marinas. \nD. Minimum residential density.

Visitor \nParking and Undedicated General Parking, as described in Sections 33.510.261 and 33.510.262, are \nCommercial Parking. The other types of parking are accessory parking, although either may operate \nas commercial parking according to 33.510.261 and 33.510.262.  \n33.510.114 Exemptions for Portland State University \nDevelopment by Portland State University within the University District / South Downtown is \nexempt from the Conditional Use requirements of Chapter 33.815, Conditional Uses, in situations \nwhere a use would be allowed if it was not associated with the University. Instead, such \ndevelopment is subject only to the regulations of the base zone, overlay zone, and plan district. \n33.510.115 Additional Uses Allowed in the Open Space Zone \nA. Purpose. Additional uses are allowed on sites zoned OS within the Central City plan district \nin recognition of the diversity of functions that Central City open spaces provide to \nresidents and visitors. The Central City’s open spaces tend to be more urban than open \nspaces found outside the Central City. Plazas, parks, and other improved outdoor spaces \nfound in the Central City may be designed for a more intensive use, and may include little \nor no green space. These open spaces may contain buildings, benches, art, coffee shops or \nrestaurants, or other small retail shops. These uses are encouraged in urban parks in the \nCentral City to help promote downtown as a regional attraction, enhance the Central City’s \nrole in culture and entertainment, provide space for outdoor activities that are appropriate \nin an urban setting, and increase desirable activity within and near the open space. \nB. Additional uses allowed.  \n1. Retail Sales and Service uses are allowed as follows:  \na.

Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.510 \n1/1/25 Central City Plan District \n \n510-33 \n33.510.220 Ground Floor Windows \nA. Purpose. In the Central City plan district, blank walls on the ground level of buildings are \nlimited in order to: \n• Provide a pleasant, rich, and diverse pedestrian experience by connecting activities \noccurring within a structure to adjacent sidewalk areas; \n• Encourage continuity of retail and service uses;  \n• Encourage surveillance opportunities by restricting fortress-like facades at street  \nlevel;  \n• Avoid a monotonous pedestrian environment; and  \n• The plan district modifications to the base zone standards for ground floor windows \nare intended to promote ground floor windows in a larger number of situations than in \nthe base zones and to provide additional flexibility in meeting the standard. \nB. Ground floor windows. The following ground floor window standards apply in the RX, CX \nand EX zones. To meet the standards, ground floor windows must be windows that allow \nviews into work areas or lobbies, or be windows in pedestrian entrances. Windows into \nstorage areas, vehicle parking areas, garbage and recycling areas, mechanical and utility \nareas and display cases attached to outside walls do not qualify. Windows into bicycle \nparking areas are allowed to qualify for up to 25 percent of the ground floor windows \ncoverage requirement. The bottom of the windows of nonresidential spaces must be no \nmore than 4 feet above the finished grade: \n1. Ground level facades that face a street or open area shown on Map 510-8 must have \nwindows that cover at least 60 percent of the ground level wall area. For the purposes \nof this standard, ground level wall area includes all exterior wall area from 2 feet to 10 \nfeet above the finished grade. Until January 1, 2029, the standard for development \nthat includes a residential use is 40 percent of the ground level wall area. \n2. All other ground level facades that face a street lot line, sidewalk, plaza, or other \npublicly accessible open area or right-of-way must have windows that cover at least \n40 percent of the ground level wall area. For street facing facades of dwelling units the \nregulations of 33.130.230.B.4 apply. For the purposes of this standard, ground level \nwall area includes all exterior wall area from 2 feet to 10 feet above the  \nfinished grade. \n3. Optional artwork. Projects proposing to use artwork as an alternative to the ground \nfloor window requirements may apply for this through the adjustment procedure. \nProjects may also apply for a modification through design review if they meet the \nfollowing qualifications. Buildings having more than 50 percent of their ground level \nspace in storage, parking, or loading areas, or in uses which by their nature are not \nconducive to windows (such as theaters), may be allowed to use the design review \nprocess. Artwork and displays relating to activities occurring within the building are \nencouraged. In these instances, the artwork will be allowed if it is found to be \nconsistent with the purpose for the ground floor window standard.  Chapter 33.510 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Plan District 1/1/25 \n510-34 \n33.510.223 Bird-Safe Exterior Glazing  \nA. Purpose. The bird-safe glazing standards are intended to reduce the risk of bird-to-building \ncollisions. The standards reduce the transparency, or reflectivity, of exterior windows and \nother glazed surfaces, thereby improving the visibility of exterior glazed surfaces to birds. \nThe reduction in transparency applies to the portions of buildings that studies show are \nassociated with the greatest occurrence of bird strikes.   \nB. Development subject to the bird-safe exterior glazing standards. The bird-safe glazing \nstandards apply to new buildings and major remodeling projects. For new buildings, the \nstandards apply per façade when the façade has 30 percent or more glazing, including \nspandrel glazing, within the first 60 feet measured from the grade adjacent to the facade. \nFor major remodeling projects, the standards apply per facade when at least 75 percent of \nthe façade is altered and the altered facade has 30 percent or more glazing, including \nspandrel glazing, within the first 60 feet measured from the grade adjacent to the facade. \nThe standards also apply to glazing located directly adjacent to an ecoroof, roof garden, or \nother vegetated or landscaped roof area. The standards do not apply to houses, attached \nhouses, manufactured homes, accessory dwelling units, duplexes, attached duplexes, \ntriplexes, historic landmarks, and contributing resources in historic or conservation \ndistricts. \nC. Bird-safe exterior glazing standards. At least 90 percent of the windows and glazing on the \nfollowing portions of each façade must choose treatment patterns and application \ntechniques from the Portland Bird Safe Windows List:  \n1. Windows and glazing, including glazed balcony railings, located within the first 60 feet \nof the building measured from the grade adjacent to the facade; \n2. Windows and glazing located within the first 15 feet of the building above an adjacent \necoroof, roof garden, or other vegetated or landscaped roof area; and  \n3. The glazed portions of sky bridges or fences. \n33.510.225 Ground Floor Active Uses \nA. Purpose. The ground floor active use standards are intended to reinforce the continuity of \npedestrian-active ground-level building uses. The standards help maintain a healthy urban \ndistrict through the interrelationship of ground-floor building occupancy and street level \naccessible activities, and they encourage a transit-supportive, pedestrian-oriented \nenvironment that is safe, active with uses, and comfortable for residents, visitors, and \nothers. Active uses include but are not limited to: lobbies and other common areas of the \nbuilding, retail, commercial, and office uses, but do not include storage, vehicle parking, \ngarbage, recycling, mechanical, or utility uses. \nB. Sites and development subject to the ground floor active use standard. The ground floor \nactive use standards apply on sites with frontage on a street shown on Map 510-9. \nStandards C.1 and C.3 apply to new development and major remodels. Standard C.2 only \napplies to new development. \n \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.510 \n1/1/25 Central City Plan District \n \n510-35 \nC. Ground floor active use standards.  \n1. Dwelling units are prohibited on the ground floor within 25 feet of the street lot line of \na street shown on Map 510-9. Development that includes a residential use is exempt \nfrom this standard until January 1, 2029. \n2. Buildings must be designed and constructed to accommodate uses such as those listed \nin Subsection A. Areas designed to accommodate these uses must be developed at the \ntime of construction. This standard must be met along at least 50 percent of the \nground floor of walls that are at an angle of 45 degrees or less from the street lot line \nof a street shown on Map 510-9, a plaza, or other public open space. \n \nAreas designed to accommodate active uses must meet the following standards. \nAccessory structures are exempt from the standards: \na. The distance from the finished floor to the bottom of the structure above must \nbe at least 12 feet. The bottom of the structure above includes supporting \nbeams; \nb. The area must be at least 25 feet deep, measured from the street-facing façade \nor wall; \nc. The area may be designed to accommodate a single tenant or multiple tenants. \nIn either case, the area must meet the standards of the Accessibility Chapter of \nthe State of Oregon Structural Specialty Code. This code is administered by  \nPP&D; and \nd. The street-facing facade or wall must include windows and doors.  \n3. In the Pearl District and West End subdistricts, on the portion of a site within 100 feet \nof a streetcar alignment shown on Map 510-13, parking is not allowed in the portions \nof a building that meet the ground floor active use standard of Paragraph C. \n33.510.230 Required Residential Development Areas \nA. Purpose. The requirements of this section promote new housing in areas suitable and \nattractive for housing. The requirement is imposed as an alternative to the creation of \nexclusively residential zoning. This maintains development flexibility while still promoting \nthe housing objectives of the Central City 2035 Plan. \nB. Sites and development subject to the required residential standard. Sites subject to this \nstandard are shown on Map 510-6. On identified sites, all new development must meet the \nstandards below.  \nC. Required residential standard for new development. For this standard, net site area is the \ntotal site area minus land dedicated to public rights-of-way or public open spaces, or land \nused for a regional public attraction such as a museum or aquarium. New development \nmust include at least 1 dwelling unit per 2,900 square feet of net site area (15 units per \nacre).   Chapter 33.510 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Plan District 1/1/25 \n510-36 \nD. Timing and location of the housing. Required housing must be located on the site and if \ndeveloped as part of a mixed-use project must receive an occupancy permit in advance of \nor at the same time as an occupancy permit for nonresidential portions of the project.  \n33.510.240 Drive-Through Facilities  \nDrive-through facilities are prohibited in the Central City plan district.  \n33.510.242 Demolitions  \nIn R, C, and E zones, sites must be landscaped within 6 months of the demolition of buildings unless \nthere is an approved development for the site. Approved development means a project approved \nthrough design review in design zones, and issuance of a building permit outside of design zones. \nThe landscaping must meet at least the L1 standard of Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening, \nexcept that no shrubs or trees are required.  \n33.510.243 Ecoroofs  \nA. Purpose. Ecoroofs provide multiple complementary benefits in urban areas, including \nstormwater management, reduction of air temperatures, mitigation of urban heat island \nimpacts, air quality improvement, urban green spaces, and habitat for birds, plants and \npollinators. The standards are intended to: \n• Maximize the coverage of ecoroofs;  \n• Allow for the placement of structures and other items that need to be located on \nroofs; and  \n• Support the architectural variability of rooftops in the Central City. \nB. Ecoroof standard. In the CX, EX, RX, and IG1 zones, new buildings with a net building area \nof 20,000 square feet or more must have an ecoroof that meets the following standards. \nUntil January 1, 2029, development that includes a residential use can choose to meet \nSubsection B. or C. below: \n1. The ecoroofs, including required firebreaks between ecoroofs areas, must cover 100 \npercent of the building roof area, except that up to 40 percent of the building roof \narea can be covered with a combination of the following. Roof top parking does not \ncount as roof area. Roof area that has a slope greater than 25% does not count as roof \narea: \na. Mechanical equipment, housing for mechanical equipment, and required access \nto, or clearance from, mechanical equipment; \nb. Areas used for fire evacuation routes; \nc. Stairwell and elevator enclosures;  \nd. Skylights;  \ne. Solar panels; \nf. Wind turbines;  \ng. Equipment, such as pipes and pre-filtering equipment, used for capturing or \ndirecting rainwater to a rainwater harvesting system;   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.510 \n1/1/25 Central City Plan District \n \n510-37 \nh. Uncovered common outdoor areas. Common outdoor areas must be accessible \nthrough a shared entrance; or \ni. Uncovered individual unit outdoor area directly accessible to the dwelling unit. \n2. The ecoroof must be approved by the Bureau of Environmental Services as meeting \nthe Stormwater Management Manual’s Ecoroof Facility Design Criteria. \nC. Temporary exception for solar panels. Until January 1, 2029, in the CX, EX, RX, and IG1 \nzones, new buildings with a net building area of 20,000 square feet or more that include a \nresidential use can provide solar panels as an option to meeting Subsection B above. The \nsolar panels, including the access space between panels, must cover 100 percent of the \nbuilding roof area, except that up to 40 percent of the building roof area can be covered \nwith a combination of the following. Roof top parking does not count as roof area. Roof \narea that has a slope greater than 25% does not count as roof area: \n1. Mechanical equipment, housing for mechanical equipment, and required access to, or \nclearance from, mechanical equipment; \n2. Areas used for fire evacuation routes; \n3,  Stairwell and elevator enclosures;  \n4. Skylights;  \n5. Wind turbines; \n6.

Common outdoor areas must be accessible \nthrough a shared entrance; or \n8. Uncovered individual unit outdoor area directly accessible to the dwelling unit. \n33.510.244 Low-Carbon Buildings \nA. Purpose. The low-carbon building standard encourages development that achieves third \nparty green building certification. Buildings that are third party certified tend to have a \nlower carbon footprint and increased energy efficiency as compared to buildings that do \nnot have green building certifications. In addition, green buildings help to preserve natural \nresources and protect the health of occupants.  \nB. Low-carbon building standard. New development with a net building area of at least \n50,000 square feet, and alterations to existing development that increase net building area \nby at least 50,000 square feet must provide a letter from the Bureau of Planning and \nSustainability that verifies that the project has registered for a green building certification \nprogram, approved by the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, and has prepared a \npreliminary description of how the building can achieve the certification. \n \n33.510.250 Additional Standards in the Pearl Subdistrict. Sites in the Pearl subdistrict south of \nthe Fremont Bridge and north of NW Lovejoy Street must meet the following standards:  Chapter 33.510 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Plan District 1/1/25 \n510-38 \nA. Special building height. A special building height corridor shown on Map 510-18 is \ndesignated along NW 13th Avenue. In this corridor the portion of a building that is within \n20 feet of the property line along NW 13th Avenue may be no more than 75 feet in height. \nAdjustments to this requirement are prohibited. \nB. Pearl subdistrict waterfront development. \n1. Purpose. These standards are intended to ensure both physical and visual connections \nto the river and river-based activities. \n2. Where these standards apply. This section applies only to lands between NW Front \nAvenue and the Willamette River within the Pearl subdistrict. \n3. Development standards. \na. View corridors. At least 25 percent of the width of the site (as measured along \nNW Naito Parkway) must be maintained as a view corridor or corridors. Buildings \nand covered structures are not allowed in the view corridor. \nb. Setbacks for all development from the Willamette River. The minimum setback \nfor all development from the Willamette River is regulated by the River Overlay \nzones; see Chapter 33.475.  \nc. Maximum building dimension. The maximum building dimension is 200 feet. This \nstandard applies to both building length and depth.  \nd. Public access. As part of each development, public access for pedestrians must \nbe available and clearly posted between NW Naito Parkway and the  \nmajor public trail. \n33.510.251 Additional Standards in the South Waterfront Subdistrict \nSites in the South Waterfront subdistrict must meet the following standards. \nA. Special building height corridors and tower orientation. \n1. Purpose. Special building heights along designated east-west corridors and tower \norientation standards provide visual access to the Greenway from points west of the \ndistrict, provide visual access to the Tualatin Hills from points east of the district, \nprovide access to sunlight along designated streets, and encourage an urban form that \nis visually permeable and varied. \n2. Special building heights. The portion of a building that is within 50 feet of the \ncenterline of a street or accessway designated as a special building height corridor on \nMap 510-15 may be no more than 50 feet in height. \n3. Maximum north-south dimension. The north-south dimension is measured as \nspecified in Subparagraph A.3.e. See Figure 510-1. Adjustments to this paragraph are \nprohibited; however, modifications to the standards of this paragraph may be \nrequested through design review. In reviewing such a request, the review body will \nconsider the results of the South Waterfront Public Views and Visual Permeability \nAssessment for the proposal. The north-south dimensions of buildings are limited  \nas follows:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.510 \n1/1/25 Central City Plan District \n \n510-39 \na. Less than 75 feet in height. For the portion of a building less than 75 feet in \nheight, there is no limit on the north-south dimension, and no required space \nbetween buildings or portions of buildings; \nb. 75 feet in height and above. The portion of a building that is at least 75 feet in \nheight may have a north-south dimension up to 125 feet in width; \nc. Where there is more than one building on a site there must be at least 50 feet \nbetween the portions of the buildings that are at least 75 feet in height. If there \nis less than 50 feet between these portions of the buildings, the north-south \ndimension is the total of the north-south dimension of each building and the \nnorth-south dimension of the space between them. The total may be up to 125 \nfeet in width; \nd. Where a building has more than one element that is at least 75 feet in height, the \ntwo elements are measured and regulated as two separate buildings; \ne. Measurements for this paragraph. The measurements for the regulations of this \nparagraph are as follows. See Figure 510-1: \n(1) The north-south dimension of a building is measured as follows: \n• From the northernmost point of the portion of a building that is at least \n75 feet in height, a line is drawn running due east-west; \n• From the southernmost point of the portion of a building that is at least \n75 feet in height, a line is drawn running due east-west; \n• A line drawn at right angles between the two east-west lines is the \nnorth-south dimension; \n(2) The space between buildings on a site is measured using the east-west lines \ncreated under A.3.e.(1). A line drawn at right angles between the northern \neast-west line of one building and the southern east-west line of the other is \nthe distance between the buildings.  Chapter 33.510 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Plan District 1/1/25 \n510-40 \nFigure 510-1 \nMeasuring North-South Dimension \n \nB. Accessways. \n1. Purpose. Accessways provide physical access and connections to the Greenway for \nneighbors, visitors, and residents of South Waterfront who might otherwise be cut off \nfrom the Willamette River and the Greenway trail. Accessways are generally \nextensions of existing and planned east-west public rights-of-way, and may or may not \nprovide vehicle access. Accessways provide safe and convenient bicycle and \npedestrian connections to and from the Greenway trail. Accessways contribute to \nstormwater management in the subdistrict. They also provide a visual connection to \nthe South Waterfront Greenway Setback Area and provide a transition from the \nnatural emphasis of the South Waterfront Greenway Setback Area to the urban \nemphasis of the rest of the district. \n2. Where these regulations apply. These regulations apply to development and \nlandscaping on sites with frontage on accessways that are east of River Parkway; \n3. Setback. If the accessway is 60 feet wide or less, buildings must be set back at least 30 \nfeet from the centerline of the accessway. If the accessway is wider than 60 feet, the \nbuilding must meet the building line requirements of Section 33.510.215 on the \naccessway frontage; \n4. Landscaping. The area between the building and the accessway must meet the \nlandscaping standards of 33.510.253.E.5.g(5) that apply to subarea 3 of the South \nWaterfront Greenway Setback Area. However, along accessways that are designated \nas special building height corridors on Map 510-15, trees are not required. \nC. Locker rooms and additional bicycle parking. \n1. Purpose. These standards support the transportation strategy of the South Waterfront \nSubdistrict by requiring amenities that support the use of alternative modes of \ntransportation, including bicycling and walking;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.510 \n1/1/25 Central City Plan District \n \n510-41 \n2. When these regulations apply. The regulations of this subsection apply to proposals \nthat will add at least 100,000 square feet of nonresidential floor area to a site; \n3. Locker rooms. At least one locker room facility must be included in the proposal. The \nfacility must include showers, a dressing area, and lockers. The facility must be \navailable for use by all tenants of the building; and \n4. Exception for existing long-term bicycle parking. \na. Purpose. These regulations allow existing uncovered long-term bicycle parking to \ncontinue without upgrading the nonconforming elements of the racks. The \nexisting, attendant monitored, bicycle parking provides a convenient and secure \nlong-term bicycle parking option that works in conjunction with the suspended \ncable transportation system that provides access to both the Marquam Hill plan \ndistrict and South Waterfront subdistrict of the Central City plan district.   \nb. Where these standards apply. These standards provide an alternative to the \nlong-term bicycle parking standards in 33.266 and apply to required long-term \nbicycle parking facilities in the South Waterfront subdistrict of the Central City \nplan district.   \nc. Existing Bicycle Parking. Existing long-term bicycle parking may be used to meet \nrequired long-term bicycle parking. The existing bicycle parking is not required to \nmeet Subsections 33.266.210.C and D if the long-term bicycle parking meets the \nfollowing: \n(1) The bicycle parking is located in the South Waterfront subdistrict of the \nCentral City plan district as of March 1, 2020;  \n(2) The bicycle parking area has an attendant present during the hours of 6:00 \nam to 7:30 pm from Monday to Friday to monitor the area and aid in \nparking bicycles;  \n(3) The bicycle parking area does not exceed 500 spaces; \n(4) The bicycle parking must be within 100 feet of a suspended cable \ntransportation system; and \n(5) The applicant must sign a covenant that ensures that the existing long-term \nbike parking will continue to meet the above standards until the bike \nparking is no longer required. The covenant must comply with the \nrequirements of 33.700.060, Covenants with the City. \n33.510.252 Additional Standards in the Central Eastside Subdistrict \nThe following additional standards apply in the Central Eastside subdistrict. \nA. Industrial impacts disclosure statement. \n1.  Purpose. This requirement is intended to ensure that people who choose to live or \nwork in the Central Eastside subdistrict are aware of the potential impacts, such as \nnoise, vibration, odors, glare, and heavy truck traffic that stem from industrial and \nemployment uses.   Chapter 33.510 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Plan District 1/1/25 \n510-42 \n2. Disclosure statement required. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for a new \nbuilding that will contain a Household Living, Retail Sales And Service, or Office use, \nand for alterations to an existing building that contains a Household Living, Retail Sales \nAnd Service, or Office use, the owner of the property must sign and record a copy of \nthe City’s Industrial Impacts Disclosure Statement. The statement must be recorded in \nthe records of Multnomah County.

Purpose. A Central City Master Plan establishes a clear development strategy for significant \nredevelopment sites in the Central City. Central City Master Plan review is intended to \nensure that development on the site will positively contribute to the existing and desired \nsurrounding urban form. The review will result in an urban design framework and layout \nfor the site as a whole, allowing subsequent reviews for individual buildings and other \ndevelopment to focus on materials and façade treatment. A Central City Master Plan is \nintended to result in the following urban design outcomes: \n• A development site that has a strong orientation towards transit and multimodal \ntransportation alternatives. \n• A safe and vibrant public realm, supported by active ground floor uses, open space \nareas and an internal circulation system that provides access to adjacent public rights-\nof-way and multimodal transportation options;  \n• A development site that has adequate urban services such as water, stormwater, \nsewers, and fire-hydrants, and  \n• Building bulk, height, orientation, and programming that protects public views and \npreserves light and air within the public realm, and is oriented to active and passive \npublic gathering spaces, including public open spaces, transit stations, and the \nWillamette River. \nB. When a Central City Master Plan review is required. \n1. Central City Master Plan review is required for the following types of development in \nthe areas shown on Map 510-19: \na.

There can be more than one lot and more than \none site within the boundaries of a voluntary Central City Master Plan. \nD. Flexibility allowed. An approved Central City Master Plan review allows additional \nflexibility in the following situations: \n1. Floor area may be transferred among sites within the master plan boundary without \nhaving to meet the prioritization in 33.510.205.B; \n2. The minimum floor area ratio standard in 33.510.200.C.2 may be met for the master \nplan area as a whole rather than on a site-by-site basis;  \n3. The bonus height limits shown on Map 510-4 may be achieved without having to \nprovide the bonuses or transfers required by 33.510.210.D.3; and \n4. Residential uses may be allowed on the sites shown on Map 510-6 as allowing \nresidential uses through a Central City Master Plan. \nE. Review procedure. A Central City Master Plan is processed through a Type III procedure.  \nF.  Design advice request. A design advice request is required prior to submitting an \napplication for a Central City Master Plan review.  \nG.  Components. A Central City Master Plan must include the following components: \n1. Boundaries. The boundaries of the master plan area must be shown on a site plan. For \nsites where a Central City Master Plan is required, the boundary must include all \ncontiguous lots in common ownership within the area shown on Map 510-19. \nContiguous includes lots across a shared right-of-way. Lots in separate ownership may \nbe included, but are not required.  \n2. Proposed urban design and development framework. The following materials must be \nincluded to provide clear visual information about the proposal: \na. A site plan showing the following: \n(1) Location, size, and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures, and \nthe location of all main entrances to existing and proposed buildings; \n(2) Location, size and dimensions of the building coverage of all proposed \nstructures; \n(3) Description of existing and proposed land uses. The description must \ninclude information as to the general amount, type and location of all uses;  \n(4) Existing and proposed internal pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicle circulation \nsystem, including where each part of the proposed system connects to \npublic rights-of-way adjacent to the master plan boundary, and transit \nservice lines and stations within or adjacent to the master plan boundary; \n(5)  Existing and proposed location of public rights-of-way;  \n(6) Location of bicycle and vehicle parking; and  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.510 \n1/1/25 Central City Plan District \n \n510-57 \n(7) Location, size and shape of all open areas such as parks, plazas, landscaped \nand hardscaped areas and outdoor recreation amenities including those \nthat are required in 33.510.255.K. \nb. A three-dimensional massing diagram that identifies the maximum existing and \nproposed building envelopes, with proposed building dimensions and height for \neach building, including building massing where a tower will be setback from the \nedge of a podium; and \nc. Sections, sectional elevations, and perspectives that illustrate the relationship of \nsite redevelopment to the surrounding urban form in terms of building height \nand massing. \n3. Project narrative. A narrative that describes the project, identifies how the Central City \nMaster Plan is consistent with the applicable design guidelines. Specific information \nabout the proposed range and density of land uses and the proposed phasing of \ndevelopment must also be included. If the proposed Central City Master Plan involves \nthe transfer of floor area, information about the location of the receiving and sending \nsites, the ownership of the sites, and amount of floor area to be transferred and \nretained at each site must be included. \n4. Infrastructure capability. The adequacy of infrastructure must be addressed. The plan \nmust identify and link the development of each phase of the project to the provision \nof services necessary to meet the infrastructure needs of the development associated \nwith that phase.  \n5. Design advice. A copy of the design advice request summary. \nH. Approval Criteria. A Central City Master Plan review will be approved if the review body \nfinds that the following approval criteria have been met. Criteria H.1 through H.11 apply to \nall Central City Master Plan reviews. Criteria H.12 through H.15 also apply to proposals \nwithin the area identified on Map 510-6 as requiring a Central City Master Plan review for \nresidential uses. \n1. The Central City Master Plan is consistent with applicable subdistrict goals and policies \nof the Central City 2035 Plan; \n2.  The master plan demonstrates how development will comply with the Central City \nFundamental Design Guidelines, as well as any applicable design guidelines specific to \nthe subdistrict the master plan site is located within;  \n3. Development on lots with river frontage incorporates elements that activate the \nriverfront, such as open areas, trails, accessways, and active land uses that encourage \npublic use and enjoyment of the riverfront; \n4. The proposed uses will not have significant adverse effects on industrial firms or result \nin conflicts with industrial activities located within the plan boundary or within 500 \nfeet of the plan boundary; \n5.  The master plan demonstrates that development within the plan boundary will \nestablish an overall building orientation through massing, the location of entrances, \nand the location of ground floor uses that result in an edge that embraces adjacent  Chapter 33.510 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Plan District 1/1/25 \n510-58 \npublic park rather than creating an abrupt edge between the plan area and parks, and \nensures that development within the plan boundary will not excessively shade the \nadjacent park;  \n6. The master plan demonstrates that easy and safe access will be provided to transit \nstations located within or immediately adjacent to the master plan boundary, and any \nbuildings located immediately adjacent to a transit station include ground floor uses \nthat create an active and safe pedestrian environment throughout the day, evening, \nand week; \n7. Internal open areas are accessible within, and distributed throughout, the master plan \narea and have connections to the surrounding neighborhood and to any adjacent \nopen space. Internal open areas enhance visual permeability through the site, \nespecially on sites near the Willamette River. The size and location of each open area \nmust be adequate to accommodate the intended use of the space.  \n8. The transportation system is capable of supporting the proposed uses in addition to \nthe existing uses in the plan area. Evaluation factors include street capacity, level of \nservice, connectivity, transit availability, availability of pedestrian and bicycle \nnetworks, access restrictions, neighborhood impacts, impacts on pedestrian, bicycle, \nand transit circulation, and safety. Evaluation factors may be balanced; a finding of \nfailure in one or more factors may be acceptable if the failure is not a result of the \nproposed development, and any additional impacts on the system from the proposed \ndevelopment are mitigated; \n9. The proposed street plan must provide multi-modal street connections to support the \nsurrounding street grid pattern; \n10. The plan ensures that there will be adequate and timely infrastructure capacity for the \nproposed development; and \n11.  The master plan demonstrates that, to the extent practical and feasible, inactive uses \nsuch as, but not limited to, parking and access, loading, and trash and recycling are \nshared or consolidated, with the goal of activating the pedestrian environment. \n12. The proposal will not have a significant adverse effect on truck and freight movement; \n13. City-designated scenic resources are preserved;  \n14. Proposed residential uses are buffered from potential nuisance impacts from uses \nallowed by right in the zone; and \n15. The master plan includes a design, landscape, and transportation plan that will limit \nconflicts between residential, employment, and industrial uses. \nI. Amendments to a Central City Master Plan. Unless specifically addressed in the approved \nCentral City Master Plan review, an amendment to an approved master plan is required for \nthe following changes. The amendment request must meet the applicable approval criteria \nin 33.510.255.H.  \n1. Major change. The following major changes are processed through a Type III review:  \na. Changes to the boundary of the master plan area;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.510 \n1/1/25 Central City Plan District \n \n510-59 \nb. Removing a proposed public right-of-way, or moving a proposed public right-of-\nway more than 10 feet; \nc. Removing an open area, or changing the location, dimension, or area of an open \narea as required by 33.510.255.K by more than 5 percent or 10 feet; or \nd. Changing a condition of approval of the master plan. \n2. Minor change. A minor change is one that is neither major nor administrative. Minor \nchanges are processed through a Type II review. \n3. Administrative change. Administrative changes are allowed without a land use review. \nAn administrative change meets all of the following:  \na. The change is consistent with all conditions of the master plan approval and the \nconditions of any concurrent approval; \nb. The change meets all development standards not modified by the master plan; \nand  \nc. Other than the boundary of the master plan, the change does not change any \nlocation, quantity, dimension, or area identified in the approved plans or \nnarrative by more than 5 percent or 10 feet. Changes to the boundary of the \nmaster plan are a major change. \nJ. Duration. An approved Central City Master Plan remains in effect until development \nallowed by the plan has been completed, except that a Central City Master Plan expires 10 \nyears from the date of the final decision if none of the development or activity allowed by \nthe plan has commenced. \nK. Open area requirement.  \n1. Purpose. The open area requirements promote a site design that provides access to \nlight and air, opportunities for outdoor activities including active and passive \nrecreation, public gathering spaces, and visual relief from the built environment. The \nstandards are also intended to produce open areas at a scale compatible to what large \nsites would have if divided by the 200 foot street grid pattern common through the \nCentral City. \n2. Amount of required open area. A minimum of 20 percent of the master plan area \nmust be devoted to open area. Open areas may include parks, outdoor recreation \namenities, plazas, public fountains, or landscaped areas. Areas used for parking, \nloading, and driveways do not count toward the 20 percent minimum open area \nrequirement. \n3. Required open area development standards. \na. At least 20,000 square feet, or 50 percent, whichever is less, of the required open \narea must be designed as parks or plazas. At least one of the parks or plazas must \nhave dimensions that allows a 50 foot by 50 foot square to fit entirely within It, \nand in Central City Master Plan Area 6, shown on Map 510-19, at least one park \nor plaza must be located directly adjacent to the OS zone.  Chapter 33.510 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Plan District 1/1/25 \n510-60 \nb. Bike and pedestrian accessways may not constitute more than 25 percent of the \nrequired open space. \nc. The open space must meet one of the following tree density standards. Tree \ncanopy sizes are defined in 33.248.030.C.2:  \n(1) A minimum of one tree per 1,000 square feet of park or plaza area is \nrequired if all of the trees are small canopy trees; or \n(2) A minimum of one tree per 2,000 square feet of park or plaza area is \nrequired if at least one medium or large canopy tree is provided. \nd. Parks and plazas must be sited so that shadows from buildings cover no more \nthan 50 percent of the park or plaza at noon on March 21, June 21 and \nSeptember 21, and not more than 75 percent of the adjacent open space at noon \non December 21, and 3:00 pm on March 21, June 21, and September 21. \n33.510.257 Signs for Additional Uses Allowed in the Open Space Zone \nThe sign standards are stated in Title 32, Signs and Related Regulations. \nParking and Access \n33.510.261 Parking Built After July 9, 2018 \nA. Purpose. The parking and access regulations implement the Central City 2035 Plan and the \nTransportation System Plan by managing the supply of off-street parking to improve \nmobility, promote the use of alternative modes, support existing and new economic \ndevelopment, maintain air quality, and enhance the urban form of the Central City. \nB. Description of types of parking. In the Central City plan district, there are three types of \nparking. While a proposal may include several types of parking (for example, a garage may \ninclude both some Growth Parking and some Preservation Parking), each type of parking is \nan exclusive category. The same spaces can be more than one type of parking, such as both \nGrowth Parking and Visitor Parking, if the regulations for both types are met.  \n1. Growth Parking. Growth Parking. Growth Parking is created in conjunction with \nadditions of net building area. Net building area is added either as part of new \ndevelopment or by adding floor area to existing development. \n In the case of new development, the land use or building permit for the parking must \nbe requested by the time the foundation of the new building is complete. If the \nparking is requested after the foundation is complete, it will be Preservation Parking.  \n In the case of additions of net building area to existing development, the land use or \nbuilding permit for the parking must be requested by the time the building permit for \nthe new net building area is issued. If it is requested after the building permit for the \nnew net building area is issued, it will be Preservation Parking.  \n The ratios for Growth Parking are based on the needs of both employees and those \nwho come to the building for other reasons, such as customers and clients.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.510 \n1/1/25 Central City Plan District \n \n510-61 \n2. Preservation Parking. Preservation Parking is created to serve existing buildings. The \nratios for Preservation Parking are based on the needs of both employees and those \nwho come to the building for other reasons, such as customers and clients. \n3. Visitor Parking. Visitor Parking is created to serve shoppers, tourists, and other such \nvisitors who make occasional trips to the area. It is not associated with a particular \ndevelopment. \nC. Organization of parking regulations. This subsection describes the organization of parking \nregulations that follow, and provides a framework for understanding. See the sections that \nfollow for the specific regulations described below.  \n Generally, Growth Parking and Preservation Parking are allocated based on net building \narea of buildings or dwelling units. Visitor Parking may be located where demand is shown. \n Each type of parking is regulated differently. For some types of parking, there are no limits \non who may park there, even though the parking may have been created in conjunction \nwith a particular development.  \n Map 510-10 shows the Central City plan district parking sectors. There are maximums for \nparking in all of the parking sectors. In some cases, Central City Parking Review may be \nrequired, while other proposals may need adjustments.  \nD. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of Sections 33.510.261 apply to parking \nbuilt after July 9, 2018. Where there is more than one type of parking included in a \nproposal, each type of parking must meet the regulations in the appropriate subsection.  \nE. Sites split by parking sector boundaries. If the site is split by parking sector boundaries, \nand the maximum ratio in the two sectors differ, the maximum ratio is based on the \nregulations that apply to the site of the use the parking will be serving.  \nF. Growth Parking. The regulations of this subsection apply to Growth Parking. Adjustments \nto the regulations of this subsection are prohibited. \n1. When Growth Parking is allowed. Growth Parking is allowed when net building area is \nadded to a site either as part of new development or an alteration to existing \ndevelopment.  \n2. Maximum allowed parking. Growth Parking is limited to the maximum ratios in Table \n510-2. Where there is more than one use on a site, the amount of parking allowed is \ncalculated based on the net building area of each use.  \n3. Operation. Growth Parking may be operated as either accessory or commercial \nparking at all times.   Chapter 33.510 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Plan District 1/1/25 \n510-62 \nG. Preservation Parking. The regulations of this subsection apply to Preservation Parking. \nAdjustments to this subsection are prohibited. \n1. When Preservation Parking is allowed. Preservation Parking is allowed when approved \nthrough Central City Parking Review. Existing buildings with Residential or hotel uses \nthat have 0.5 or fewer parking stalls per unit or room are eligible to apply for \nPreservation Parking. In the South Waterfront subdistrict, existing buildings with \nTable 510-2 \nMaximum Parking Ratios [1]  \nUses \n \nParking Sectors \n \n1 \nNorth Pearl \n2 \nNorth/ \nNortheast \n3 \nGoose \nHollow \n4 \nCore  \n5 \nCentral \nEastside \n6 \nSouth \nWaterfront \nHousehold Living  \n \n \n1.2 per \ndwelling \nunit \n1.2 per \ndwelling \nunit \n1.2 per \ndwelling \nunit \n1.2 per \ndwelling \nunit \n1.2 per \ndwelling \nunit \n1.2 per \ndwelling \nunit \nGroup Living \n \n \n1 per 4 \nbedrooms \n1 per 4 \nbedrooms \n1 per 4 \nbedrooms \n1 per 4 \nbedrooms \n1 per 4 \nbedrooms \n1 per 4 \nbedrooms \nOffice, Retail Sales And \nService, Schools, \nColleges, Daycare 1.5 1.35 1.5 1.0 2.0 2.0 \nGrocery Store 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 \nAnchor Retail [2] 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 \nHotel/motel and  \nmeeting or conference \nrooms \n1 per hotel/motel room, plus 1 per 1,000 square feet of meeting/conference \nrooms. \nManufacturing and \nProduction, Warehouse \nand Freight Movement, \nWholesale Sales, \nIndustrial Service 1.0 \n \n \n \n \n2.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 \nMedical Center 1.5 1.35 1.5 1.5 2.0 2.0 \nMajor Event \nEntertainment, \nCommercial Outdoor \nRecreation, Parks And \nOpen Areas \nParking requires Central City Parking Review and must meet the Visitor parking \napproval criteria in 33.808.100. \nCommunity Service, \nReligious Institutions, \nTheaters, and all other \nuses .5 .5 .5 .5 .5 .5 \n[1] Unless stated otherwise in the table, maximum ratios are per 1,000 square feet of net building area.  \n[2] Anchor retail is a single structure with more than 50,000 square feet of net building area in Retail Sales \nand Service uses. \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.510 \n1/1/25 Central City Plan District \n \n510-63 \nMedical Center or College uses are eligible to apply for Preservation parking. Other \nexisting buildings that have fewer than 0.7 parking stalls per 1,000 square feet of net \nbuilding area are eligible to apply for Preservation Parking.  \n2. Location of Preservation Parking. Preservation Parking must be built within the same \nparking sector as the building the parking will serve. Parking sectors are shown on \nMap 510-10. \n3. Maximum allowed parking. The maximum ratio for Preservation Parking is the same as \nfor Growth Parking, except for hotels and motels where the maximum ratio is one half \nthe ratio allowed for new hotels. See Table 510-2. Where there is more than one use \non a site, the amount of parking allowed is calculated based on the net building area \nof each use. \n4. Required covenants. Preservation Parking requires the following covenants: \na. Common ownership. If the parking is based on the net building area of buildings \nunder the same ownership as the parking, the following must be met: \n(1) The owner must specify which buildings the parking is based on; \n(2) The owner must execute a covenant with the City that ensures that the \nparking will be primarily for those buildings for at least 10 years. The \ncovenant must meet the requirements of 33.700.060, Covenants with the \nCity, and must be recorded and attached to the deed for the property. \nb. Different ownership. Where the parking structure is under different ownership \nthan the buildings the parking will serve, the following must be met: \n(1) Covenant: \n• There must be signed and recorded covenants between the owner of \nthe parking and the owners of buildings for which the parking will be \nprovided. The covenants must specify which buildings the parking is \nbased on, and ensure that the parking will be primarily for those \nbuildings for at least 10 years from the date the garage begins \noperation. The covenant must meet the requirements of 33.700.060, \nCovenants with the City, and must be recorded and attached to the \ndeed for the property; and  \n• A copy of the covenant must be provided to Portland Permitting & \nDevelopment as part of the application for a building permit. Written \ndocumentation must be provided that shows that the changes comply \nwith the regulations of this Chapter. \n(2) Changes to existing covenants. Changes to a covenant between the owner \nof the parking and owners of buildings for which the parking is provided are \nallowed only if the regulations of this Chapter are still met. The length of the \ncovenant cannot be reduced to cover fewer than 10-years from the date the \ngarage began operation. The applicant must notify Portland Permitting & \nDevelopment in writing of any changes to existing covenants.  Chapter 33.510 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Plan District 1/1/25 \n510-64 \n(3) New covenants. A new covenant between the owner of the parking and the \nowners of buildings for which the parking will be provided is allowed only if \nthe regulations of this Chapter are still met. The length of the covenant \ncannot be reduced to cover fewer than 10-years from the date the garage \nbegan operation. The applicant must notify the Director of the Bureau of \nTransportation in writing of any new covenants. \n5. Operation. Preservation Parking may be operated as either accessory or commercial \nparking at all times. \nH. Visitor Parking. The regulations of this subsection apply to Visitor Parking. Adjustments to \nthis subsection are prohibited. \n1. When Visitor Parking is allowed. Visitor Parking is allowed when approved through \nCentral City Parking Review. \n2. Maximum allowed parking. There are no maximum parking ratios for Visitor Parking. \nThe appropriate number of parking spaces allowed is determined based on a demand \nanalysis, traffic analysis, and other considerations specified in the approval criteria for \nCentral City Parking Review.  \n3. Operation. Visitor Parking is operated as commercial parking, except as follows:  \na. “Early Bird” discounts are prohibited on weekdays, and \nb. The sale of monthly permits that allow parking between 7:00 AM and 6:00 PM on \nweekdays is prohibited. \nI. All parking built after July 9, 2018.

Visitor Parking must operate as Visitor Parking for at least 10 years before it may \nbe changed to Preservation Parking. Changing Visitor Parking that has been \noperating for less than 10 years is prohibited. \n33.510.262 Parking Built before July 9, 2018  \nA. Purpose. With adoption of the Central City 2035 Plan, the regulations for parking in the \nCentral City plan district were significantly revised. To simplify and streamline regulations \nfor parking that existed when the regulations changed, operation restrictions have been \nreduced. \n The new regulations do not supersede other types of approvals such as existing \nPreservation Parking covenants, design review and adjustments. \nB. Where these regulations apply. These regulations apply to all parking that legally existed \non July 9, 2018. The regulations also apply to all parking where a complete application was \nreceived before July 9, 2018, or parking that received either a land use or building permit \nbefore July 9, 2018.  \nC. Assignment of parking types. The parking types assigned below are the same types as \ndescribed in Subsection 33.510.261.B.; or if not assigned below the parking is Undedicated \nGeneral. Undedicated General is all parking other than Visitor Parking, that is not \nassociated with a particular development.  \n1. If the parking was built as Growth Parking it continues to be Growth Parking. \n2. If the parking was built as Preservation Parking it continues to be Preservation Parking. \n3. If the parking was built as RX Zone Parking or Residential/Hotel Parking it is now \nGrowth Parking.  \n4. If the parking was built as Visitor Parking it continues to be Visitor Parking. \n5. All other parking is Undedicated General Parking. \nD. Operation. \n1. If the parking is in a structure: \na. Growth and Preservation parking may operate as accessory or commercial \nparking.  \nb. Visitor Parking is operated as commercial parking except as follows:  \n(1) “Early Bird” discounts are prohibited on weekdays, and \n(2) The sale of monthly permits that allow parking between 7:00 AM and 6:00 \nPM on weekdays is prohibited.  \nc. Undedicated General Parking is subject to all previous conditions of approval. \n2. If the parking is on a surface parking lot: \na. Growth Parking:  Chapter 33.510 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Plan District 1/1/25 \n510-68 \n(1) Unless specified in Subsubparagraph D.2.a.(2), Growth Parking may operate \nas accessory or commercial parking.

The plan district regulations also protect significant environmental and \nscenic resources and maintain the capacity of the area infrastructure to accommodate future \ndevelopment. Special street setbacks and landscaping standards enhance and strengthen the image \nof the plan district, and create a more formal landscape design and provide continuity along Airport \nWay. Development standards for the southern portion of the district (Southern Industrial \nsubdistrict) reflect the City’s standards for general industrial areas.  \nSpecial development standards for the frontages along Airport Way and Marine Drive are intended \nto: \n• Enhance the street image of the plan district through continuity in street frontage \nlandscaping along Airport Way; \n• Soften the visual impact of buildings, semi-trucks and trailers, and outdoor storage along \nAirport Way and Marine Drive; and \n• Encourage non-auto-oriented travel to, from, and within the district. \n33.515.020 Where the Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to the Columbia South Shore plan district. The boundaries of \nthe plan district, including all subdistricts, are shown on Map 515-1 at the end of this chapter, and \non the Official Zoning Maps. The areas affected by Columbia South Shore Streetscape standards are \nshown on Map 515-2.  \n33.515.025 Relationship Among Subdistrict Regulations \nThe Southern Industrial subdistrict is exempt from certain regulations of this plan district. The \nstreetscape standards for Airport Way and Marine Drive apply in addition to the other requirements \nof the plan district. When there is a conflict between streetscape regulations, the more restrictive \nregulations apply for that portion of the site. \nUse Regulations \n33.515.110 Uses in the Industrial Business Opportunity Subdistrict \nA. Purpose. Certain industrially-oriented office uses are allowed through limited review if \nthere is excess capacity in the transportation system and there is an industrial component \n(use or building adaptability). These uses may contribute a higher level of employment and \npedestrian activity compatible with the industrial district. \nB. Uses. For sites within the Industrial Business Opportunity subdistrict, the uses listed below \nare reviewed through a Type II conditional use. The Industrial Business Opportunity \nsubdistrict is shown on Map 515-1 at the end of this chapter. Criteria are found in \n33.815.301. Uses listed in this section that do not meet the standards of Subsection C. \nbelow are reviewed through a Type III conditional use using approval criteria of 33.815.125. \nThe uses are:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.515 \n6/30/23 Columbia South Shore Plan District \n \n515-3 \n1. Research and development; \n2. Data processing; \n3. Operation centers for industrial and business uses; and  \n4. Other uses similar to the above. \nC. Standards \n1. These offices are located in either single tenant buildings or in industrial  \nflex-space buildings. \n2. Flex-space buildings must have 50 percent or more of the floor area built with \ncharacteristics suitable for a wide range of industrial activities. Industrial building \ncharacteristics include an overall height of not more than two stories, a minimum \nceiling height of 15 feet, and a dock high or drive-in loading area serving each tenant. \n3. The development standards of this chapter are met.  \n33.515.120 Commercial Uses \nA. Retail Sales And Service uses in the EG2 zone are limited to 20,000 square feet or less of \nnet building area including any exterior storage or nonconforming exterior display per site. \nThe 20,000 square foot limitation does not apply to hotels or motels. \nB. Office uses in the EG2 zone are limited to a net building area not to exceed 45 percent of \nthe total site area. \nC. The IG2 zone regulations allow four Retail Sales And Service uses of up to 3,000 square feet \neach of net building area including any exterior storage or nonconforming exterior display \nper site without a conditional use review. Within the Industrial Business Opportunity \nsubdistrict, sites zoned IG2 are allowed a single Retail Sales And Service use of up to 12,000 \nsquare feet of net building area including any exterior storage or nonconforming exterior \ndisplay without a conditional use review, in lieu of the four separate uses. \n33.515.130 Additional Conditional Uses \nA. Columbia Riverfront. \n1. Conditional uses. The uses listed below are allowed in the RF zone through a \nconditional use review. The uses are: \na. Marinas; \nb. Rental of recreational equipment; and  \nc. Houseboat moorages.  \n2. Regulations. \na. These uses are subject to the development standards of the CE zone. \nb. The applicant must obtain separate approvals for building on or riverward of any \nflood control structure, including dikes, from the Oregon Division of State Lands,  Chapter 33.515 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nColumbia South Shore Plan District 6/30/23 \n515-4 \n \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Multnomah County Drainage  \nDistrict No. 1. \n3. Conditional use approval criteria. Requests are subject to the same approval criteria as \nfor other conditional uses in residential zones, found in 33.815.105. Compatibility with \nthe scenic and functional qualities of the Columbia River and Marine Drive will be \nconsidered in lieu of considering the compatibility with adjacent residential \ndevelopment, stated in criterion 33.815.105.B. \nB. Commercial parking facilities.  \n1. New commercial parking facilities. Any new commercial parking facilities must locate \nsouth of the Columbia Slough or west of Interstate 205, and are conditional uses \nsubject to 33.815.300.  \n2. Existing commercial parking facilities are allowed as a conditional use. Changes to such \nfacilities are subject to 33.815.300. The appropriate review procedure for the \nconditional use will be determined through 33.815.040.D. \n3. Site changes resulting from realignment of roadway. Commercial parking facilities \nexisting prior to September 3, 1993 may maintain the same number of parking spaces \nthat existed on that date. If a roadway project results in reconfiguration of the site, \nthe same number of parking spaces may also be reconfigured by right. The parking \nspaces may be on the site or on land adjacent to the site. This section confers only the \nright to maintain existing parking spaces and does not expand other rights provided by \nnonconforming provisions of this title. \nC. Professional / technical facilities. \n1. For sites zoned IG2, professional/technical facilities are reviewed through a Type II \nconditional use. Approval criteria are in 33.815.302. \n2. The maximum number of parking spaces on the site is 1 space per 300 square feet of \nnet building area. \n3. Supplemental application requirements: \na. A transportation study is required if the proposed use will generate 100 or more \nnew vehicle trips in the peak direction (inbound or outbound) during the site \npeak traffic hour. The Bureau of Transportation will evaluate the transportation \nstudy as part of the conditional use review. \nb. A transportation demand management plan is required, which should address \nthe respective responsibilities of the training facility and participating firms in \nmeasures to mitigate traffic impacts. \nD. Retail Sales And Service. \n1. Retail Sales And Service uses that have net building area plus exterior display and \nstorage area in excess of the limits in 33.515.120.A or C are allowed only through a \nconditional use review. The approval criteria are in 33.815.303, Retail Sales and \nService Uses in the Columbia South Shore plan district.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.515 \n6/30/23 Columbia South Shore Plan District \n \n515-5 \n In the IG2 zone, the total area of all the Retail Sales And Service and Office uses on a \nsite, taken together, may not exceed 20,000 square feet. More than 20,000 square \nfeet is prohibited unless allowed by Paragraph 2 below. These limits include net \nbuilding area plus exterior display and storage areas. \n2. Retail Sales And Service uses that have net building area plus exterior display and \nstorage area in excess of 25,000 square feet, which existed on September 1, 1996, or \nfor which a complete application was received under Section 33.700.080 by \nSeptember 1, 1996, may change to another use in the same use category without a \nland use review if there is no increase in net building area or exterior  \nimprovement area.  \nDevelopment Standards \n33.515.200 Streetscape Standards \nThe development standards foster distinct, yet complementary streetscapes for NE Airport Way and \nMarine Drive.  \n33.515.205 Airport Way Streetscape  \nA. Purpose. Special streetscape standards for NE Airport Way are intended to enhance and \nstrengthen the image of the plan district; unify public and private improvements; and \nprovide for a safe, comfortable, and attractive pedestrian environment. \n The Airport Way streetscape embodies the following themes: \n• Integrating public and private frontage landscaping; \n• Minimizing the visual impact of certain exterior development activities; \n• Limiting the size, number, and types of signs; and  \n• Providing on-site pedestrian circulation. \nB. Where the regulations apply. East of Interstate 205, the Airport Way streetscape standards \napply to sites within 300 feet of NE Airport Way. The Airport Way streetscape standards \nsupersede less restrictive regulations of this or other chapters. \nC. Items allowed in setback. Development which abuts Airport Way must be set back at least \n25 feet from Airport Way. The following items are allowed in the building setback: utility \nstructures, public monument signs, driveway entries, pedestrian paths and water quality \nfacilities. The 25-foot setback must be landscaped and maintained in conformance with \nSection 33.515.210 and Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening.  \nD. Exterior storage, heavy trucks and equipment, and work activities. Certain types of \nexterior development are an integral part of industrial uses. However, exterior \ndevelopment should be located and screened to not detract from the intended appearance \nof the NE Airport Way streetscape. Firms that require extensive exterior development \nareas are encouraged to locate in the Southern Industrial subdistrict. \n1. Exterior work activities and exterior storage of equipment and materials, including \nheavy trucks, are not allowed within 150 feet of the NE Airport Way property line. \nVehicles staged at a loading dock are excepted.  Chapter 33.515 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nColumbia South Shore Plan District 6/30/23 \n515-6 \n \n2. The outer perimeter of all such exterior storage must be landscaped, meeting one of \nthe standards stated below. \na. Option 1. Perimeter landscaping must be at least 5 feet wide and meet the  \nL3 standard. \nb. Option 2. For each 30 feet of frontage along Airport Way, one tree and four high \nshrubs must be planted within a minimum 5-foot wide perimeter  \nlandscape area.  \n33.515.210 Airport Way Landscaping \nA. Purpose. Special landscape standards apply along NE Airport Way in order to:  \n• Provide a consistent landscape pattern that unifies public and private areas;  \n• Establish a landscaped streetscape which recognizes both aesthetics and safety; \n• Accommodate a wide variety of uses;  \n• Provide a buffer between on-site development and pedestrian and vehicular \ncirculation in the right-of-way;  \n• Ensure that exterior development will not detract from the appearance of the area;  \n• Protect views of natural resource areas while limiting access to those areas; and  \n• Ensure public and private setback landscaping is maintained consistently and \nadequately. \nB. Where the regulations apply. Landscape standards for Airport Way apply to sites that abut \nAirport Way, as shown on Map 515-2 at the end of this chapter.  \nC. General standards. These standards apply to the 25-foot setback from Airport Way. All \nlandscaping in the setback must be installed to comply with Chapter 33.248, Landscaping \nand Screening, and the NE Airport Way Landscape Design Handbook, adopted September \n3, 1993. For ongoing maintenance, the standards of the NE Airport Way Landscape \nMaintenance Handbook, adopted September 3, 1993, must be met. \n1. 25-foot landscaped setback. The first 10 feet from the right-of-way is a public \neasement for utilities and landscaping. The next 15 feet is a private setback. Together \nthey form the required 25-foot setback described in 33.515.205.C.  \n2. Responsibilities for landscaping improvements. Prior to the issuance of a final \ncertificate of occupancy, the full 25-foot landscaped setback must be installed. In most \ncases, the Portland Development Commission (PDC) has already fully landscaped the \n10-foot public easement. On those sites, the applicant must install landscaping in the \n15-foot private setback to match landscaping installed by PDC. On sites without full \nlandscaping on the 10-foot easement, the applicant must also landscape the public \neasement to the standards detailed in the NE Airport Way Landscape Design \nHandbook. “Full” landscaping consists of trees, shrubs, and ground cover plants.  \nD. Stormwater treatment swales. Stormwater treatment swales may be placed within the 15-\nfoot private setback, provided the tree pattern is maintained and any nonvegetated swales \nare visually screened from Airport Way.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.515 \n6/30/23 Columbia South Shore Plan District \n \n515-7 \n1. The spacing of trees in the private setback is considered maintained if the trees are \nplanted perpendicular from Airport Way with the specified tree planting. Landscape \nplans that do not maintain the tree pattern may be considered through an adjustment \nreview. A landscape adjustment is reviewed for consistency with the purpose \nstatement of this section and the NE Airport Way Landscape Design Handbook. \n2. If the swale includes over 100 square feet of nonvegetative cover materials, an \nevergreen screen must be placed in the first 5 feet of the 15-foot private setback \nadjacent to the 10-foot public easement. Shrubs for the evergreen screen must be \nplanted in a double row spaced to a minimum 6 feet on center. \n33.515.215 Marine Drive Streetscape and Landscape \nA. Purpose. Streetscape and landscape standards for Marine Drive are intended to preserve \nand enhance the character of Marine Drive. The standards emphasize the roadway corridor \nand distant views rather than adjacent development. Marine Drive is a scenic roadway that \nprovides public views from the street right-of-way and the adjacent recreational trail. The \nroadway is elevated on a levee twenty to thirty feet above the elevation of adjacent \nproperties. From this elevated position, it has a sense of openness, with views along and \nacross the river and to Mt. Hood.  \n This section provides standards for a vegetative edge to screen development. Clustered \nforeground landscaping is intended to provide visual focal points to divert the eye from \nbuildings and exterior uses. \nB. Where the regulations apply. This section applies to the portions of sites within 200 feet \nsouth of the Marine Drive right-of-way. The affected areas are shown on Map 515-2 at the \nend of this chapter. \nC. Streetscape standards.  \n1. Building heights. Within 200 feet south of the Marine Drive right-of-way, building \nheight limits are imposed to maintain the open character. Building height is measured \nto the top of the parapet or exterior wall, whichever is higher. Within 100 feet of the \nright-of-way, buildings are limited to 35 feet in height.

Wildflower and grass species should be native to the \nWillamette Valley or to the Pacific Northwest. \n6. New embankments. New embankments extending from Marine Drive must be planted \nwith flowering shrubs. For every 50 feet of embankment, a cluster of flowering shrubs \nmust be planted on each slope of the embankment. Shrub species must be chosen \nfrom Subparagraph D.3.a, above. The shrubs must be planted at least 20 feet from the \ntoe of the Marine Drive slope. \nE. Landscape standards for parking lots and storage areas. Vehicle areas and exterior storage \nareas may be located within 3 feet of the tree row required by Paragraph D.1, above. \nInstead of meeting the perimeter landscaping standards of Chapter 33.266, one of the \nfollowing standards must be met:  Chapter 33.515 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nColumbia South Shore Plan District 6/30/23 \n515-12 \n \n1. No recreational trail. Except as provided in Paragraph E.3, below, where a site does \nnot include the recreational trail, a row of shrubs is required. See Figure 515-2. The \nshrubs must meet the following: \na. Location. The row of shrubs must be within 5 feet of the tree row required by \nParagraph D.1, above, and be staggered with the tree row. \nb. Spacing. The shrubs must be planted on seven and a half foot centers. \nc. Species. The shrubs must be one of the species listed in Subparagraph  \nD.3.a, above. \n2. Recreational trail. Except as provided in Paragraph E.3, below, where a site includes \nthe recreational trail, and the recreational trail is both south of Marine Drive and \nbelow the grade of the road, no additional landscaping is required. However, the \nshrubs required by Subparagraph D.3.b, above, must be between the recreational trail \nand the tree row required by Paragraph D.1, above. See Figure 515-3. \n3. Entryway locations along Marine Drive. Where the site is in one of the entryway \nlocations specified in Paragraph D.4, above, the applicant may choose between two \nsets of Marine Drive landscape standards. \na. If the applicant chooses to meet the standards of Paragraphs D.1 through D.3, \nabove, the standards for parking lots and exterior storage areas in Paragraphs E.1 \nor E.2 must be met. \nb. If the applicant chooses to meet the standards of Paragraph D.4, a row of shrubs \nmust be planted that meets the following: \n(1) Location. The row of shrubs must be planted within 5 feet of the north edge \nof the parking or exterior storage area; \n(2) Spacing. The shrubs must be planted on seven and a half foot centers; and \n(3) Species. The shrubs must be one of the species listed in Subparagraph D.3.a, \nabove. \nF. Nonconforming landscaping. Some sites along Marine Drive have a double row of trees, \nwhich was required by previous regulations. Some of these trees are within 25 feet of the \ntoe of the Marine Drive slope. There also may be shrubs within 20 feet of the toe of  \nthe slope. \n If trees and shrubs that are nonconforming because of their location are removed, they \nmust be replaced as follows: \n1. Trees. Each tree removed must be replaced. The replacement tree must be of the \nspecies listed in Paragraph D.1, and must be planted in a location that meets the \nrequirements of Paragraph D.1. \n2. Shrubs. Each shrub removed must be replaced. The replacement shrub must be of the \nspecies listed in Paragraph D.3, and must be planted in a location that meets the \nrequirements of Paragraph D.3.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.515 \n6/30/23 Columbia South Shore Plan District \n \n515-13 \n33.515.225 Transfer of Floor Area \nAs part of a land division or Planned Development, a transfer of floor area within and between lots \nin the land division or Planned Development is allowed as long as the overall floor area potential of \nthe entire site is maintained. The proposed maximum floor area for each lot must be stated on the \nland use application. Maximum floor area allowances must be recorded on the deed or record. Any \nsubsequent changes to the floor area allocation must also be noted on the deed and a copy of the \ndeed submitted to Portland Permitting & Development to ensure consistency with the overall floor \narea limits. \n33.515.230 View Corridors  \nA. Purpose. Building heights are limited along four view corridors to protect views of Mt. \nHood and Rocky Butte from selected vantage points in Columbia South Shore. The four \nview corridors are shown on Map 515-3 at the end of this chapter, and are: the view of \nRocky Butte from the Glenn Jackson Bridge; the view of Mt. Hood from the Interstate 205 \nbicycle bridge over Airport Way; the view of Mt. Hood from the cross-dike over the \nColumbia Slough; and the view of Mt. Hood from the intersection that connects Airport \nWay with NE 185th Avenue. \n1. The view of Rocky Butte from the Glenn Jackson Bridge provides motorists and \nbicyclists with an orientation point when they enter Northeast Portland. The forested \nslopes of Rocky Butte offer the eye a green refuge among the industrial landscape and \ndenote entryways to the City from the north and east.  \n2. The Interstate 205 bicycle bridge is a significant recreational resource. Protecting this \nview of Mt. Hood will enhance the scenic quality and recreational value of the  \nbicycle path.  \n3. From the cross-dike, the slough lines up with Mt. Hood and forms a natural setting for \nthe mountain view. South of NE Airport Way, the cross-dike is a designated \nRecreational Trail, providing a north-south link between NE Airport Way, Columbia \nSlough and residential areas located south of NE Sandy Boulevard. \n4. The dramatic glimpse of Mt. Hood from the intersection that connects Airport Way \nwith NE 185th Avenue provides a break in the planned industrial landscape and a \ndirectional orientation.  \nB. Building height. Maximum building heights for the four view corridors are shown on  \nMap 515-3.  \n33.515.235 Rooftops  \nA. Purpose. Rooftops in the plan district are highly visible from Marine Drive, view corridors, \nand Airport Way. Rooftop standards are intended to reduce the visual impact of rooftop \nsurfaces and rooftop mechanical equipment from those vantage points.  \nB. Where the regulations apply. The rooftop standards apply to all parts of South Shore \nexcept for the Southern Industrial subdistrict.  \nC. Rooftop mechanical equipment. These standards apply to rooftop mechanical equipment. \nThey do not apply to roof-mounted solar panels and wind turbines.   Chapter 33.515 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nColumbia South Shore Plan District 6/30/23 \n515-14 \n \n1. Latticework screen wall. Within 200 feet of Marine Drive, Airport Way, or a view \ncorridor vantage point, all rooftop mechanical equipment must be screened from view \nor not visible from those vantage points. Screen materials will consist of a full screen \nwall or latticework screen wall. The screen wall need not extend more than one foot \nabove rooftop equipment. The latticework screen may be constructed of a variety of \npermanent materials, but must be 50 percent sight-obscuring and painted to match \nthe roof or closest wall, whichever is the predominant visible surface from those \nvantage points. \n2. Painting to match rooftop. Each rooftop mechanical equipment unit that interrupts \nless than 25 square feet of roof surface area may be painted instead of screened, as \nprovided in Paragraph C.1. The paint color must match the rooftop color or closest \nwall, whichever is the predominant visible surface from Marine Drive, Airport Way, or \na view corridor vantage point. \n33.515.240 Exterior Display \nExterior display is prohibited in the Columbia South Shore plan district. \n33.515.245 Signs \nThe sign standards are stated in Title 32, Signs and Related Regulations. \n33.515.255 Sumps, Septic Tanks, and On-Site Disposal Systems  \nNew sumps, septic tanks, cesspools, and other on-site disposal systems for sanitary disposal or \ndisposal of industrial process water are prohibited. All on-site storm water and wastewater \ntreatment and disposal systems must be disposed of into a system approved by the Bureau of \nEnvironmental Services and Portland Permitting & Development. \n33.515.257 Pedestrian Standards \nAll developments in the plan district are subject to the pedestrian standards of the EG2 zone.  \n33.515.260 Major Public Trails  \nA. Major public trail requirements. All sites with a major public trail symbol shown on the \nOfficial Zoning Maps must comply with the requirements of Chapter 33.272, Major Public \nTrails, except those in the Columbia South Shore Slough Trail area or Cross-Levee Trail area. \nSites in these areas, shown on Map 515-4, must also comply with the regulations of this \nsection. If the trail is located within the Environmental zones, the trail must also comply \nwith those requirements. \nB. Columbia South Shore Trail.  \n1. Columbia South Shore Slough Trail area. The recreation trail designations that apply to \nthe Columbia South Shore Slough Trail are shown on Map 515-4 at the end of  \nthis chapter. \n2. Columbia South Shore Slough Trail requirement. Prior to occupancy of any new or \nremodeled structure on a site containing a trail designation, the owner must either \nmake the full trail improvement or pay into the Columbia South Shore Recreational \nTrail Trust Fund, with one exception: a property owner must build the trail at the time  \nof development if both ends of their trail segment connect with another built trail or  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.515 \n6/30/23 Columbia South Shore Plan District \n \n515-15 \npublic right-of-way. The chosen option must be indicated on the building permit. If the \ntrail improvement option is chosen, the trail location and construction specifications \nmust be shown on the site plans.  \na. Trust fund option. The Columbia South Shore Recreational Trail Trust Fund \nprovides a method for accepting and dedicating funds for the Slough Trail \nconstruction in the Columbia South Shore plan district and an alternative to \nconstructing the on-site trail segment.  \n(1) Trust fund administration and contribution. The trust fund is administered \nby Portland Parks and Recreation. As sufficient funds accrue in the trust \nfund, the Parks Bureau will use the funds to build segments of the trail \nsystem. The trust fund contribution is based on the trail development costs \nformula determined by the Parks Bureau. \n(2) Cap on trust fund contributions. If the trail costs more than one percent of \nan improvement project planned for the site, the trust fund contribution is \nbased on one percent of the project cost. Trust fund contributions and total \nproject costs are each cumulative from April 7, 1987. “Cumulative” means \nthat all trust fund contributions from that date and all project costs from \nthat date are included in the calculation. If the total trust fund contribution \nfor a site reaches the amount of the trail construction costs, then no further \ntrust fund contributions are required.  \n(3) Timing of contributions. Contributions to the trust fund can be made either \nat the time of development or in advance of development. A property \nowner must show that the trust fund contribution and easement have been \ngiven to the City before a building permit will be issued. \nb. Developed sites without the trail. Portland Parks and Recreation will construct \nthe trail on sites previously developed without the trail when the following \nconditions are met:  \n(1) The property owner has granted a trail easement to the City, and either (2) \nor (3) below is met. \n(2) The trail development costs have been paid into the trust fund at the time \nof the easement dedication; or \n(3) The property owner has agreed to repay the trust fund for the trail \ndevelopment costs when the property redevelops. A property owner must \naccept a lien on the property to secure repayment costs. Repayment is \nrequired before any building permit requiring the trail is issued. The \nrepayment is based on the trail development costs formula determined by \nPortland Parks and Recreation.  \nc. Trail and easement location.  \n(1) In environmental zones: \n• The location of the trail or easement is subject to environmental review;  Chapter 33.515 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nColumbia South Shore Plan District 6/30/23 \n515-16 \n \n• If a trail or easement exists on an adjacent site, the trail or easement \nmust connect to them; and \n• If there is not an easement or trail on an adjacent site, the easement \nmust be located in the outer 25 feet of the environmental zone. The \ntrail improvement must be at least 5 feet from the outer edge of the \nenvironmental zone. See Figure 515-5.  \n(2) In all other zones: The trail route must be as shown on the Official  \nZoning Maps. \nC. Cross-Levee Recreation Trail easement. The Cross-Levee public recreation trail is shown on \nthe Official Zoning Maps and on Map 515-4 at the end of this chapter. The requirement for \na trail does not apply to the Cross-Levee Recreation Trail but the requirement for an \neasement does apply. (See Section 33.272.020). \nD. Other recreation trails. Other recreation trails are regulated by Chapter 33.272. \nFigure 515-5 \nColumbia South Shore Slough Trail and Easement Location \n \n33.515.262 Archaeological Resource Protection \nA. Purpose. Archaeological evidence has confirmed that American Indians used the plan \ndistrict prior to entry of EuroAmericans to the Portland area. Archaeological resources have \nhistoric, cultural, and scientific value to the general public and heritage value to associated \ntribes, whose ancestors lived in the plan district area and harvested local natural resources \nfor subsistence and spiritual/ceremonial uses. Of special concern is the potential for ground \ndisturbance activities to uncover human remains and archaeological resources that may be \neligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.515 \n6/30/23 Columbia South Shore Plan District \n \n515-17 \n Specific purposes of this section are to: \n• Protect inventoried significant archaeological resources and their functional values in \nthe Columbia South Shore plan district in a way that increases certainty of \ndevelopment potential; \n• Promote compliance with state and federal laws intended to protect archaeological \nresources, including the state archaeological permit process and federal grave \nprotection laws; \n• Encourage coordination between property owners; appropriate tribal governments; \nand City, state, and federal agencies regarding archaeological resources; \n• Encourage the development community and archaeologists to file site records with the \nState Historic Preservation Office (SHPO); \n• Limit disclosure of archaeological resource records to protect confidentiality and \ndiscourage the destruction of archaeological resources; and \n• Provide a process for developers and appropriate tribes to explore alternatives to full \nprotection of archaeological resources, such as conservation easements. \nB. Archaeological resource values. For purposes of this section, an archaeological resource is \na resource identified through a SHPO archaeological permit process relating to use by \nAmerican Indians before the entry of EuroAmericans to the Portland area. These \narchaeological resources have strong heritage and scientific values, as identified in the \nArchaeological Resources Protection Plan for Columbia South Shore. Much of the plan \ndistrict has been inventoried.  \nC. Where the regulations apply. The requirements of this section apply to: \n1. Archaeological resources identified in the Archaeological Resources Protection Plan \nfor Columbia South Shore within the Archaeological Sensitivity Areas shown on Map \n515-6 at the end of this chapter; and  \n2. Properties for which additional confirmation testing is required, as shown on Map \n515-7. When confirmation testing has been completed, this section only applies to \narchaeological resources identified as part of that testing. \n3. The requirements of this section do not apply to sites or portions of sites where no \narchaeological resources have been identified and no additional confirmation testing \nis required. \nD. Identification of archaeological resources. \n1. Purpose. There is a public interest in testing for archaeological resources prior to \nproject construction. The earlier an archaeological resource is found and evaluated, \nthe better are chances that reasonable development proceeds without delay and the \narchaeological resource is protected. Confirmation testing can reduce the chances \nthat archaeological resources are encountered during project construction. Much of \nthe plan district has already received confirmation testing using a consistent \nmethodology. This section requires that applicants fill gaps in confirmation testing \nwithin archaeological sensitivity areas. \n2. Use of SHPO records and procedures for this section.  Chapter 33.515 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nColumbia South Shore Plan District 6/30/23 \n515-18 \n \na. \"Archaeological resource\" is a resource identified through a SHPO archaeological \npermit process. An archaeological resource must meet one or both of the \nfollowing:  \n(1) An archaeological site that meets SHPO guidelines, plus a 5 foot vertical \nbuffer and a 5 foot horizontal buffer, as shown in Figure 515-6, \nArchaeological Resource Subareas. The vertical buffer extends directly \nabove the most shallow archaeological materials found in the site records. \nThe horizontal buffer extends sideways from the archaeological  \nresource; or \n(2) A traditional, sacred, or cultural use site, as documented in writing by an \nappropriate Oregon tribe through a SHPO permit. \nb. The SHPO maintains a list of \"qualified archaeologists\" knowledgeable in \nAmerican Indian lifeways of the lower Columbia River of the pre-contact period, \nand determines if an \"identified archaeological resource\" exists on the subject \nproperty. \"Consultation with Oregon tribes\" means following SHPO procedures \nfor consultation on state archaeological permits. \nc. The Legislative Commission on Indian Services identifies the \"appropriate Oregon \ntribes.\" \nd. All auger probes filed with the SHPO by a qualified archaeologist count toward \nfulfilling the requirements of this section.  \n3. Discovery during project construction. The zoning code does not address new \ndiscoveries of archaeological resources found during project construction. The \napplicant should be aware of state and federal regulations that apply to  \nsuch discoveries. \n4. The applicant should check with the SHPO archaeologist as to whether a state \narchaeological permit is needed. \n5. Confirmation testing not required.  \na. For sites located outside an \"archaeological sensitivity area,\" as shown on Map \n515-6, the requirements of this section do not apply. \nb. For sites located within an \"archaeological sensitivity area,\" as shown on Map \n515-6 and not designated \"confirmation testing required\" on Map 515-7, the \napplicant must either provide written documentation that there is no \narchaeological resource on the site or meet the regulations of this section. To \nqualify for exemption from this section, such written documentation must \nspecify that confirmation testing of the site is complete and that no \narchaeological resource was identified. The written documentation may be a \ncertification letter from SHPO or a zoning confirmation letter from the Portland \nBureau of Planning and Sustainability. \n6. Confirmation testing required. Additional auger testing is required for sites with some \nproperty designated \"confirmation testing required\" on Map 515-7 at the end of this \nchapter. Prior to development, the applicant must conduct confirmation testing to  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.515 \n6/30/23 Columbia South Shore Plan District \n \n515-19 \ndetermine the location and type of any archaeological resources identified on the site \nthrough current or previous archaeological testing. Confirmation testing, consisting of \nsubsurface auger probes and consultation with appropriate Oregon tribes, must meet \nall the standards of this paragraph.  \n The standards are:  \na. A qualified archaeologist, in consultation with appropriate Oregon tribes, must \nperform the confirmation testing. A list of qualified archaeologists is maintained \nby the SHPO. \nb. Subsurface auger probes must be placed along the Marine Drive levee or the \nbank of the Columbia Slough, as applicable. Auger probes must be placed at least \n100 feet apart and, where feasible, reach a ground depth of at least 8 feet below \ngrade. The qualified archaeologist will determine the precise location of auger \nprobes, consistent with previous confirmation testing in the vicinity. \nc. If an archaeological resource is identified through confirmation testing, the \nstandards for that resource and associated transition area found in Subsection G, \nbelow, apply. If no archaeological resource is identified through the testing, the \nstandards of Subsection G do not apply. \nE. Archaeological resource classification. Where an archaeological resource has been \nidentified, through previous testing or confirmation testing, a qualified archaeologist must \nclassify the archaeological resource using cumulative archaeological test results for the site. \nThe archaeological resource will be classified as one or more of these types:  \n1. Burial. A burial is an archaeological resource where there is evidence of human \nremains or funerary objects, as defined in Oregon Administrative Rules. \n2. Village. A village is an archaeological resource where there is evidence of a relatively \npermanent residential location typically occupied during the winter and on an annual \nbasis. Archaeological evidence may include remains of structures, storage pits, and \nmidden deposits. \n3. Seasonal campsite. A seasonal campsite is an archaeological resource where there is \nevidence of organized activity in extracting and processing resources on a  \nseasonal basis.  \n4. Activity area. An activity area is an archaeological resource where specific activity \n(e.g., roasting camas bulbs or stone tool making) took place.  \n5. Traditional, sacred, or cultural use site. A traditional, sacred, or cultural use site is an \narchaeological resource where there is evidence of a sacred or ceremonial site, and \nmay include vision quest sites, sites of other sacred ceremonies, and  \nsweat lodge sites. \n6. Where more than one archaeological resource is identified. Where more than one \narchaeological resource is identified together: \na. If one of the archaeological resources is a burial, the regulations for burials apply \nto all resources;  Chapter 33.515 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nColumbia South Shore Plan District 6/30/23 \n515-20 \n \nb. If any of the archaeological resources are villages; or traditional, sacred, or \ncultural use sites, and there is no burial, the regulations for villages; or \ntraditional, sacred, or cultural use sites apply to all resources; \nc. If all of the archaeological resources are seasonal campsites or activity areas, the \nregulations for seasonal campsites or activity areas apply to all resources.  \nF. Archaeological resource subareas. \n1. Archaeological resource. An archaeological resource is a resource identified through a \nSHPO archaeological permit process. An archaeological resource must meet one or \nboth of the following:  \na. An archaeological site that meets SHPO guidelines, plus a five foot vertical buffer \nand a five foot horizontal buffer, as shown in Figure 515-6, Archaeological \nResource Subareas. The vertical buffer extends directly above the most shallow \narchaeological materials found in the site records. The horizontal buffer extends \nsideways from the archaeological resource; or \nb. A traditional, sacred, or cultural use site, as documented in writing by an \nappropriate Oregon tribe through a SHPO permit. \n2. Transition area. The transition area is the area directly between the archaeological \nresource and the surface layer and extends horizontally out from the edge of the \narchaeological resource. Features associated with a resource, not identified through \nauger testing, may also be encountered in the transition area.  \na. For burials and villages, the horizontal distance is 100 feet from the \narchaeological resource.  \nb. For seasonal campsites; activity areas; and traditional, sacred, or cultural use \nsites, the horizontal distance is 50 feet from the archaeological resource. \nG. Protection of identified archaeological resources.  \n1. Ground disturbance activities within the archaeological resource and transition area \nare either allowed, limited, or prohibited, depending on the resource type. Table 515-\n1 provides a summary of the standards. Activities shown with a \"Y\" are allowed if they \ncomply with other use and development standards of this Title. Activities shown with \nan \"MOU\" are allowed through a private agreement specified in Paragraph G.6, below; \nwithout that private agreement, such activities are prohibited. The footnote letters \nfrom Table 515-1 refer to subparagraphs of Paragraph G.6, below. Activities shown \nwith an \"N\" are prohibited. \n2. For sites with identified archaeological resources, the base zone development \nstandards are modified as follows: \na. Minimum building setbacks are reduced to zero; \nb. For purposes of meeting the minimum landscaping requirements, the applicant \nmay exclude the area occupied by the archaeological resource from the total site \narea; and  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.515 \n6/30/23 Columbia South Shore Plan District \n \n515-21 \nc. The area occupied by the archaeological resource is exempt from the standards \nof 33.515.215, Marine Drive Streetscape. \n3. For archaeological resource areas of burials, all ground disturbance activities  \nare prohibited. \nFigure 515-6 \nArchaeological Resource Subareas \n \n \n4. Except for archaeological resource areas of burials, the following ongoing and low-\nimpact activities are allowed in archaeological resources and transition areas: \na. Maintenance, repair, and replacement of existing structures, exterior \nimprovements, roads, and utilities when the activity does not enlarge the ground \ndisturbance area horizontally or vertically; \nb. Lawns and landscape areas, including the installation of new irrigation and \ndrainage facilities, and new erosion control features; \nc.

All activities otherwise permitted by other regulations of this Title. All activities \notherwise permitted, other than ongoing and low-impact activities listed in Paragraph \nG.4 above, are prohibited within archaeological resource and transition areas of \nvillages; seasonal campsites; activity areas; and traditional, sacred, or cultural use \nsites, except: \na. Activities listed in Paragraph G.4 are allowed;  \nb. Activities allowed through an archaeological resource recovery plan, as provided \nin Paragraph G.6 below; and \nc. Construction of a parking lot or vehicle circulation area within the transition area \nis allowed. \n6. Archaeological resource recovery. This regulation applies to all archaeological \nresource and transition areas of Table 515-1 that have an \"MOU.\" For villages;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.515 \n6/30/23 Columbia South Shore Plan District \n \n515-23 \nseasonal campsites; activity areas; and traditional, sacred, or cultural use sites, the \napplicant must protect the archaeological resource areas either by prohibiting all \nground disturbance activities or complying with a private agreement for \narchaeological resource recovery, as stated in this paragraph. \na. For villages and traditional, sacred, or cultural use sites, an archaeological \nresource recovery plan is limited to the removal of archaeological materials \nnecessary to construct a paved parking lot or vehicle circulation area. The paved \narea must provide spill containment so that chemicals do not degrade the \nremaining archaeological resource. \nb. For seasonal campsites and activity areas, an archaeological resource recovery \nplan may remove some or all archaeological materials, as negotiated with the \nappropriate tribes and specified in the archaeological resource recovery plan. \nc. An archaeological resource recovery plan allows for the removal of \narchaeological materials following an archaeological evaluation, a consultation \nprocess with appropriate Oregon tribes, and a private agreement (Memorandum \nof Understanding) between the applicant and tribes. Each step is  \ndescribed below. \n(1) Archaeological evaluation. A detailed archaeological evaluation must be \ncompleted. The evaluation must be conducted by a qualified archaeologist. \nThe evaluation must meet standards of the SHPO for archaeological \nresource recovery projects.  \n(2) Consultation with appropriate tribes.  \n• The applicant must contact the appropriate tribes for the area, by \nregistered or certified mail, to request comments on archaeological \ntesting and offer a meeting. The Commission on Indian Services \ndetermines the appropriate Oregon tribes to be consulted.  \n• The tribes should reply to the contact within 14 days and hold a meeting \nwithin 30 days of the date of the initial contact. If the appropriate tribes \ndo not reply within 30 days, the applicant may apply for a state \narchaeological permit and implement the terms of that permit without \nfurther delay. The tribes may schedule the meeting with a tribal council, \none of its committees, or designee. \n• The purpose of the meeting is to allow tribal representatives and the \napplicant to review archaeological test results and discuss the \narchaeological resource recovery plan. More than one meeting  \nmay be held. \n• After the meetings, and before applying for a building permit, the \napplicant must send a letter to the tribal governments. The letter will \nexplain any changes in the project's design and archaeological resource \nrecovery plan since the date of the last meeting.  \n(3) Development of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The applicant \nmust develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the \napplicant, the property owner, and at least one appropriate Oregon tribe. \nThe MOU must specify the care and disposition of any archaeological  Chapter 33.515 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nColumbia South Shore Plan District 6/30/23 \n515-24 \n \nmaterials recovered on the site. The MOU must also specify how the parties \nwill communicate and how on-site monitoring will proceed during  \nproject construction. \nH. Application, Review, and Inspection.  \n1. Supplemental application requirements.  \na. No archaeological resource found. For sites within an \"archaeological sensitivity \narea,\" as shown on Map 515-6, the applicant is responsible for providing any \nevidence that no archaeological resource was found. \n(1) For sites not designated \"confirmation testing area,\" the applicant must \nprovide written documentation in the form of a certification letter from \nSHPO or a zoning confirmation letter from the Portland Bureau of Planning \nand Sustainability. \n(2) For sites that require confirmation testing, and the testing did not find an \narchaeological resource, the applicant must submit a report by a qualified \narchaeologist regarding the results of confirmation testing and the presence \nof identified archaeological resources on the site. \nb. Archaeological resource found. The applicant must provide the following \nsupplemental information. In the interest of not disclosing the location of \narchaeological resources, all maps required in (2) through (4) below will be \nstamped \"Confidential: Sensitive Information.\" Planning staff will separate this \ninformation and file it in a locked file subject to nondisclosure procedures. \n(1) Site plan. A site plan, at a scale of 1 inch = 50 feet or larger, showing the \nbuilding footprints, underground utilities and all other proposed ground \ndisturbance activities, and an estimated ground disturbance depth. The site \nplan must show the existing topography of the site.  \n(2) Confirmation testing overlay. For sites identified for confirmation testing, a \ntransparent overlay map showing all of the archaeological auger locations \ncompleted for the site.  \n(3) Archaeological resource overlay. A transparent overlay showing the \nboundaries of any archaeological resources that are recorded with SHPO or \nencountered during confirmation testing. The archaeological resource \noverlay must also show the transition area associated with each \narchaeological resource. Any conservation easements intended to protect \narchaeological resources must be shown on this overlay. \n(4) For archaeological resource recovery plans, letters to tribal governments \nand Memoranda of Understanding signed with tribal governments must be \nfiled with the building permit.  \nc. It is the applicant's responsibility to provide any archaeological reports filed with \nSHPO after July 1, 1994 to verify changes to the state's inventory affecting the \ndevelopment site. The Bureau of Planning and Sustainability will maintain a  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.515 \n6/30/23 Columbia South Shore Plan District \n \n515-25 \nconfidential atlas of identified archaeological resources within the archaeological \nsensitivity areas shown on Map 515-6 at the end of this chapter. \n2. Review of applications. \na. Where a qualified archaeologist, in consultation with the appropriate Oregon \ntribes, certifies that no archaeological resources were found through \nconfirmation testing required by this section, the Bureau of Planning and \nSustainability will provide a letter to the applicant waiving any additional \ncompliance with this section. \nb. The Bureau of Planning and Sustainability may contract with a qualified \narchaeologist to assist the City in review and inspection of proposals. \nc. The SHPO maintains a list of qualified archaeologists.  \nd. An additional fee for special archaeological evaluations and inspections may be \ncharged to the applicant for any grading permit or building permit. \n3. Compliance reports. For ground disturbance in an archaeological resource or \ntransition area, the applicant must provide documentation that the approved \nresource recovery plan or other development activities comply with plans submitted \nfor Subsection H.1.b. \na. Archaeological resource recovery plans. The required documentation for \nresource recovery plans is specified in the signed MOU. \nb. All other developments. For developments not covered by a signed MOU, the \napplicant must submit compliance reports from a qualified archaeologist to BDS. \nThe archaeologist must submit a final signed report certifying that the work was \nin conformance with this section.  \nEnvironmental Zones \n33.515.265 Purpose \nThe purpose of the environmental regulations in the Columbia South Shore plan district south of NE \nMarine Drive is to: \n• Protect inventoried significant natural resources and their functional values in the Columbia \nSouth Shore Plan District, as identified in the Comprehensive Plan;  \n• Implement the Comprehensive Plan environmental policies and objectives; \n• Encourage coordination between City, county, regional, state, and federal agencies \nconcerned with natural resources; and  \n• Protect inventoried significant archaeological resources where those resources overlap with \nan environmental protection zone or environmental conservation zone. \n33.515.268 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of Sections 33.515.265 through 33.515.280 apply to all lots or sites which contain an \nEnvironmental Zone on any portion of them, and any portion of a right-of-way which contains an \nEnvironmental Zone which are south of NE Marine Drive.   Chapter 33.515 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nColumbia South Shore Plan District 6/30/23 \n515-26 \n \n33.515.270 Overlay Zones \nA. General. Natural resource values in the district have been inventoried. Because some \nnatural resource areas have greater public benefits than others, the two environmental \noverlay zones have different emphases.  \n1. The environmental protection overlay zone is applied to areas with the highest \nfunctional values and where the natural resource is so significant that almost all \ndevelopment would have detrimental impact. The regulations of the environmental \nprotection zone are intended to preserve the resource and its values.  \n2. The environmental conservation overlay zone is applied to areas with high functional \nvalues where development may be allowed if adverse impacts are mitigated. The \nregulations of the environmental conservation zone are intended to conserve the \nresource and its values.  \nB. Subareas of the Environmental Zone in the Columbia South Shore. Each environmental \nzone in the Columbia South Shore contains a protected natural resource and a transition \narea surrounding the protected resource. The purpose of the transition area is to protect \nthe adjacent natural resource. The transition area provides a buffer between the protected \nresource and impacts of adjacent development. The transition area is the first 50 feet \ninward from the environmental zone boundary, except as shown on Map 515-5. Figure \n515-7 illustrates two different situations: when either the environmental conservation or \nenvironmental protection zone is applied, and when the two zones are applied together \nand border each other. \nFigure 515-7 \nEnvironmental Zone Subareas \n \n33.515.272 Items Subject to These Regulations \nUnless exempted in Section 33.515.274, the following are subject to the regulations of Sections \n33.515.265 through 33.515.280:  \nA.

In all zones, at least half of the open area must be in common ownership. \n33.515.280 Columbia South Shore Environmental Review \nA. Purpose of the review. Environmental review of uses and development in the \nEnvironmental zones is intended to provide adequate protection for the identified natural \nresources. The review provides for flexibility and reasonable development opportunities \nwhen development is sensitive to the special environmental concerns of the site. Within \nthe plan district, the applicant should be aware that if an archaeological resource exists on \nan area to be removed from environmental zones, the protection measures of 33.515.262 \nstill apply. \nB. Modifying Environmental Zone boundaries. Environmental zone boundaries may be \nmodified by the City as the result of and concurrent with approving development in a \nnatural resource area. The boundaries may be modified for either of the two situations  Chapter 33.515 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nColumbia South Shore Plan District 6/30/23 \n515-34 \n \nstated below. All other requests for boundary changes are processed as a change of an \noverlay zone, as stated in Chapter 33.855, Zoning Map Amendments.  \n1. Creation of new resource areas. The environmental protection zone will be expanded \nas part of the environmental review to include areas identified for mitigation.  \n2. Loss of existing resource areas. The environmental zone may be removed from an \nexisting natural resource zoned environmental conservation where approved \ndevelopment will eliminate the natural resource. The zoning designation will not be \nremoved until after all required mitigation measures have been completed.  \nC. Procedures. All required reviews are processed through a Type II procedure. \nD. Approval criteria. \n1. Fill or destruction of a natural resource in an environmental conservation zone will be \napproved if the review body finds that:  \na. All resource values listed in Figure 2-3 of the Natural Resources Protection Plan \nfor the Columbia South Shore being altered or destroyed will be replaced \nthrough mitigation. If the mitigation site is within a protected resource, values \nthat already exist do not count towards mitigation;  \nb.

The \narea is targeted to receive a significant share of the city’s growth. It is envisioned that future \ndevelopment will transform the areas surrounding the light rail stations into vibrant mixed-use areas \nof retail, office, and housing with a high level of pedestrian amenities. Lower density residential and \ncommercial development will continue to surround the Pedestrian Districts. \nThese regulations: \n• Encourage new housing and mixed use development and expansions of existing \ndevelopment to promote the corridor’s growth and light rail transit ridership; \n• Promote compatibility between private and public investments along the light rail system \nthrough enhanced building design and site layout standards; \n• Implement the objectives of the City’s Pedestrian Districts to enhance the pedestrian \nexperience and access to and from light rail service; and \n• Encourage connectivity for vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians on large sites.  Chapter 33.521 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nEast Corridor Plan District 6/1/25 \n \n521-2 \n33.521.020 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to development in the East Corridor plan district. The \nboundaries of the plan district are shown on Map 521-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the \nOfficial Zoning Maps. \nUse Regulations \n33.521.100 Purpose \nUse regulations in the East Corridor plan district ensure that development maximizes the public’s \ninvestment in transit and enhances the pedestrian environment along the transit corridor and near \nthe light rail stations by encouraging uses that support transit patrons and pedestrians. \n33.521.110 Additional Prohibited Uses \nThe following additional uses are prohibited in Pedestrian Districts and on the portion of a site \nwithin 100 feet of a light rail alignment: \nA. Vehicle Repair that is not on the same site as auto sales in the Retail Sales  \nAnd Service category; \nB. Quick Vehicle Servicing; \nC. Commercial Parking; and \nD. Self-Service Storage. \nDevelopment Standards \n33.521.200 Purpose \nDevelopment regulations in the East Corridor plan district ensure that development maximizes the \npublic’s investment in transit and fosters intense mixed-use development with a high level of \npedestrian amenities in Pedestrian Districts near light rail stations. The development regulations do \nthis by: \n• Enhancing the pedestrian experience throughout the plan district, but focusing more active, \nintense pedestrian activities around the light rail stations; \n• Increasing the development potential around the light rail stations; \n• Creating a street pattern that is oriented to pedestrians with the most urban streets around \nthe light rail stations; and \n• Limiting development that adversely affects the pedestrian environment such as exterior \ndisplay and storage and drive-throughs along the light rail alignment and in  \npedestrian Districts. \n• Encouraging the design of exterior display areas, where allowed, that are attractive and safe \nfor pedestrians. \n33.521.210 Building Height \nA. Purpose. These regulations encourage high density development within Pedestrian \nDistricts while ensuring that single-dwelling zones outside Pedestrian Districts are not \nadversely affected by the higher density development.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.521 \n6/1/25 East Corridor Plan District \n \n521-3 \nB. Maximum building height. Maximum building heights are shown on Map 521-2 at the end \nof this chapter. \nC. Transition height at edges of Pedestrian Districts. \n1. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this subsection apply to sites in a \nPedestrian District that have a maximum building height of 75 feet or more and either: \na. Abut a site zoned R7 through R2.5 that is not in the Pedestrian District; or \nb. Are across a Local Service Traffic Street from a site zoned R7 through R2.5 that is \nnot in the Pedestrian District. \n2. Abutting. Sites that abut a site zoned R7 through R2.5 have height limits that decrease \nin two steps, as follows. See Figure 521-1: \na. On the portion of the site within 25 feet of a site zoned R7 through R2.5, the \nmaximum building height is the same as the abutting residential zone; and \nb. On the portion of the site that is more than 25 feet but within 50 feet of a site \nzoned R7 through R2.5, the maximum building height is 50 feet. \n3. Across a street. Sites that are across a Local Service Traffic Street from a site zoned R7 \nthrough R2.5 have height limits that decrease in two steps, as follows.  \nSee Figure 521-1: \na. On the portion of the site within 25 feet of the street lot line, maximum building \nheight is the same as the residential zone across the street; and \nb. On the portion of the site that is more than 25 feet but within 50 feet of the \nstreet lot line, the maximum building height is 50 feet.

Purpose. These regulations encourage more intense development near light rail stations. \nThis increased development opportunity promotes higher density development at the \nstation communities along the East Burnside light rail alignment. In addition, the standards \nalso include a minimum density on some sites in order to ensure a minimum level  \nof development. \nB. Maximum floor area ratio. The maximum floor area ratios (FAR) are shown on Map 521-3 \nat the end of this chapter.  \nC. Minimum floor area ratio. The minimum floor area ratios (FAR) for all new development \nare shown on Map 521-3 at the end of this chapter. \nD. FAR bonus. The following FAR bonus options apply to sites shown on Map 521-3 as having \na maximum FAR of 4 to 1. The regulations of this Subsection do not apply where Map 521-3 \nindicates that maximum FAR for the site is the base zone maximum; on those sites, the \nbase zone bonus regulations apply. Adjustments to this Subsection, or to the amount of \nmaximum floor area allowed through the bonuses in this Subsection, are prohibited:  \n1. Maximum increase in FAR. On sites located outside of the Ventura Park Pedestrian \nDistrict, an increase in FAR through the use of bonuses of more than 1 to 1 is  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.521 \n6/1/25 East Corridor Plan District \n \n521-5 \nprohibited. An increase of more than 2 to 1 is prohibited on sites located inside the \nVentura Park Pedestrian District.  \n2. FAR bonus options: \na. Mandatory inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR is allowed for development that \ntriggers 33.245, Inclusionary Housing. The amount of bonus floor area earned is \nan amount equal to the net building area of the building that triggers 33.245. To \nqualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a letter from the Portland \nHousing Bureau certifying that the regulations of 33.245 have been met.  \nb. Voluntary inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR is allowed when one of the following \nvoluntary bonus options is met: \n(1) Bonus FAR is allowed for projects that voluntarily comply with the standards \nof 33.245.040 and 33.245.050. The amount of bonus floor area allowed is an \namount equal to the net building area of the building that complies with \n33.245.040 and .050. To qualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a \nletter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the regulations of \n33.245 have been met. The letter is required to be submitted before a \nbuilding permit can be issued for development, but is not required in order \nto apply for a land use review; or \n(2) Bonus FAR is allowed in exchange for payment into the Affordable Housing \nFund. For each square foot purchased a fee must be paid to the Portland \nHousing Bureau (PHB). The Portland Housing Bureau collects and \nadministers the Affordable Housing Fund, and PHB determines the fee per \nsquare foot and updates the fee at least every three years. The fee schedule \nis available from Portland Permitting & Development. To qualify for this \nbonus option, the applicant must provide a letter from the PHB \ndocumenting the amount that has been contributed to the AHF. The letter is \nrequired to be submitted before a building permit can be issued for the \ndevelopment, but it is not required in order to apply for a land use review. \n33.521.230 Connectivity \nA. Purpose. The connectivity requirement ensures that adequate street and \npedestrian/bicycle connections will be provided for local access to development. These \nregulations implement master street plans for the East Corridor and improve vehicular, \npedestrian, and bicycle circulation throughout the plan district, while minimizing \ncongestion on the arterial system. Pedestrian and bicycle connections provide more \nfrequent connections or may provide access where full street connections are not feasible. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The requirements of this section apply to all sites in the \nplan district. \nC. Regulations. \n1. The Portland Bureau of Transportation determines the location and widths of rights-\nof-way and extent and timing of street improvements based on a master street plan in \nthe Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan or based on Chapter 17.88.  Chapter 33.521 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nEast Corridor Plan District 6/1/25 \n \n521-6 \n2. Proposed development that may obstruct new street alignments are identified in a \nmaster street plan in the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan is \nregulated by Chapter 17.88. \n33.521.240 Pedestrian Standards \nA. Purpose. These regulations promote a convenient and attractive environment for \npedestrians within the plan district and foster the development of increasingly urban nodes \naround the light rail transit stations. The standards ensure a direct pedestrian connection \nbetween the street and buildings on the site and between buildings and other activities \nwithin the site. Together with the building design and entrance regulations, these \nstandards ensure that sidewalks in the plan district are convenient, active, pleasant \nenvironments with pedestrian amenities. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The requirements of this section apply to all sites in the \nplan district, with the exception of houses, attached houses, and duplexes, which  \nare exempt. \nC. Standards. \n1. Outside of Pedestrian Districts. Sites outside of Pedestrian Districts are subject to the \nstandards of Subsection 33.130.240.B.; \n2. In Pedestrian Districts. Sites in Pedestrian Districts are subject to the standards of \nParagraph 33.130.240.B.1. through 3., and C.3., below. \n3. Improvements between buildings and the street. The area between a building or \nexterior improvement and a street lot line must meet the standards of either \nparagraph C.3.a. or b., below. \na. Landscaped. The area between a building and a street must be landscaped to \nmeet the L1 standard in Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening; or \nb. Hard-surfaced. The area must be hard-surfaced and developed for use by \npedestrians, outdoor seating for restaurants, or pedestrian-oriented accessory \nactivities including stands selling flowers, food, or drinks. The area must contain \namenities such as benches, trees (tree wells with grates are exempt from the \nhard-surface requirement), drinking fountains, planters, and kiosks. At least one \nof these amenities must be provided for each 100 square feet of pedestrian use \narea in the setback. Pedestrian use areas in the setback required in Section \n33.526.260, Special Setbacks, must be physically separated from parking and \nmotor vehicle maneuvering areas by a 3-foot-wide area landscaped to at least \nthe L2 standard of Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening. \n4. Bicycle parking. Bicycle parking may be located in the area between a building and a \nstreet lot line. \n33.521.250 Entrances \nA. Purpose. These regulations ensure that at least one of the main entrances into a building, \nand each tenant space in a building that faces a street, be oriented to public streets or light \nrail. This requirement enhances pedestrian access from the sidewalk to adjacent buildings.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.521 \n6/1/25 East Corridor Plan District \n \n521-7 \nTogether with the building design and pedestrian standards, these standards ensure that \nsidewalks in the plan district are convenient, active, pleasant environments with a high \nlevel of pedestrian amenities. \nB. Where these regulations apply. In the RM2, RM3, RM4, and C zones, buildings must meet \nthe standards of Subsection C., below. \nC. Entrances. For portions of a building within the maximum building setback, at least one \nmain entrance for each nonresidential tenant space on the ground floor must meet the \nstandards of this section. The ground floor is the lowest floor of the building that is within \nfour feet of the adjacent street grade. Entrances that open into lobbies, reception areas, or \ncommon interior circulation space must also meet the standards of this section. The \nentrances must: \n1. Face a public street or light rail alignment; \n2. Be within 15 feet of the public street or light rail alignment it faces; \n3. Be oriented to nearby transit facilities as follows: \na. If a site abuts a street containing a light rail alignment, the entrance must orient \nto that alignment. If the proposed building is within 100 feet of a transit station, \nat least one entrance must be along the first 25 feet of the wall nearest  \nthe station. \nb. If a site abuts a transit street other than a light rail alignment, the entrance must \norient to that street. \nc. If the site abuts intersecting transit streets, the main entrance must orient to the \nstreet with the highest classification. \nd. If the site abuts intersecting transit streets with the same classification, the \nentrance may be at a 45-degree angle to both streets or within 25 feet of the \ncorner along either transit street. \n33.521.260 Building Design \nA. Purpose. These provisions promote a safe and interesting pedestrian environment by \nconnecting ground floor uses to adjacent sidewalk areas, encouraging surveillance \nopportunities by restricting fortress-like façades at street level, and by encouraging the \ncontinuity of retail and service uses. They do this by bringing buildings up to the sidewalk \nand requiring a minimum amount of ground floor windows. \nB. Applicability. All sites in the RM2, RM3, RM4, and C zones where any of the floor area on \nthe site is in nonresidential uses must meet the standards of Subsection C., below. \nC. Standards. \n1. Street enclosure. In Pedestrian Districts and at intersections where City Walkways or \ntransit streets cross another City Walkway or transit street: \na. The street-facing façade of primary structures must be within 12 feet of the \nstreet lot line.  Chapter 33.521 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nEast Corridor Plan District 6/1/25 \n \n521-8 \nb. Street-facing exterior façades must be at least 40 feet long and 16 feet high. \nc. Sites with three or more street frontages must meet standard a. and b., above, \non the two intersecting street frontages with the highest transit classifications. \nWhere streets have the same transit classification, the applicant may choose on \nwhich two intersecting streets to meet the standard. \n2. Ground floor windows. All street-facing elevations of development must meet the \nGround Floor Windows Standards of the base zone regardless of the distance to the \nadjacent street. Developments that are more than 80 percent residential are exempt \nfrom this requirement. \n33.521.270 Exterior Display and Storage \nExterior display and storage are prohibited in Pedestrian Districts and on the portion of a site within \n100 feet of a light rail alignment, except for outdoor seating for restaurants and pedestrian-oriented \naccessory uses, including flower, food, or drink stands. Temporary open-air markets and carnivals \nare also allowed. \n33.521.280 Drive-Through Facilities. \nDrive-through facilities are prohibited in Pedestrian Districts and on the portion of a site within 100 \nfeet of a light rail alignment. \n33.521.290 Parking \nA. Purpose. The regulations of this section ensure that development is oriented to transit, \nbicycling, and pedestrian travel while ensuring accessibility for motor vehicles. Limiting the \nnumber of parking spaces promotes efficient use of land, enhances urban form, encourages \nuse of alternative modes of transportation, provides for a better pedestrian environment, \nand protects air and water quality.  \n Limiting the location of parking and access on light rail alignments improves access to \ntransit, supports a transit-oriented development pattern, and reduces conflicts between \nmotor vehicles and pedestrians or bicycles. In particular, it reduces conflicts between \nmotor vehicles and light rail trains, especially where the access would require cars to cross \nthe light rail tracks. \nB. Maximum allowed parking spaces. The maximum number of parking spaces allowed for \nnonresidential uses is 150 percent of Standard A in Table 266-2 of Chapter 33.266, Parking, \nLoading, and Transportation and Parking Demand Management. The maximums apply to \nboth surface and structured parking. Park-and-ride facilities are exempt from this \nrequirement. \nC. Location of vehicle areas. \n1. Parking and loading areas are not allowed between a primary structure and any street, \nexcept as follows: \na. Sites with through lots or with three frontages may have parking and loading \nareas between a primary structure and one Local Service Transit Street.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.521 \n6/1/25 East Corridor Plan District \n \n521-9 \nb. Sites on full blocks may have parking and loading areas between a primary \nstructure and two Local Service Transit Streets. \n2. For sites with frontage on a light rail alignment, parking and loading areas are not \nallowed on the portion of the site within 100 feet of a light rail alignment, except  \nas follows: \na. Surface parking and loading that is separated from a light rail alignment by \nbuildings containing a primary use is allowed. \nb. Garages that have dimensions that do not exceed 24 feet by 24 feet are allowed \nwithin 100 feet of a light rail alignment. \nc. In C zones, structured parking and loading is allowed within 100 feet of a light rail \nalignment if the structure meets the standards of 33.526.280.D, Ground Floor \nActive Uses, along at least 50 percent of the structure’s ground floor walls that \nface the light rail alignment and front onto a sidewalk, plaza, or other public \nopen space. \n3. Driveways are subject to the following: \na. Sites with frontage on a light rail alignment. \n(1) Generally, driveways providing access from a light rail alignment are  \nnot allowed. \n(2) Exception. On sites where the only frontage is on a light rail alignment, \ndriveways are allowed to provide vehicle access from a light rail alignment. \nSee Figure 521-2. \nb. Driveways are allowed between a primary structure and a street if the driveway \nprovides a straight line connection between the street and the parking or loading \nareas allowed above. A straight line connection may not be more than 20 feet \nlonger or 120 percent of the straight line distance from the property line to the \nparking or loading area, whichever is less. \nc. Driveways are allowed in all locations where parking and loading areas \nare allowed.

Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to sites in the 122nd \nAvenue subdistrict, shown on Map 521-1. \nB. Exterior Display and Storage. \n1. Purpose. The regulations of this section encourage Retail Sales And Service uses with \nexterior display and storage to create an enhanced pedestrian environment and \npromote compatibility of design between these uses and transit-oriented \ndevelopments in the area. The regulations accomplish this by: \nAllowing, in key locations, exterior display and storage areas that enhance the \nattractiveness and safety of pedestrian environment through landscaping, and well-\ndesigned buildings and display areas; and \nFostering pedestrian-oriented development around the light rail transit station and at \nkey transit intersections, while providing flexibility in other locations and for  \nexisting development. \n2. Where exterior display and storage are allowed. Exterior display and exterior storage \nthat is accessory to a Retail Sales And Service use on the site is allowed in the areas \nshown on Map 521-4. Exterior display and storage in other areas is prohibited. The \nstandards of this subsection must be met, and no more than 20 percent of the site \narea may be used for exterior storage. Modifications of these standards may be \nrequested through Design Review; adjustments are prohibited. \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.521 \n6/1/25 East Corridor Plan District \n \n521-11 \n3. Setbacks and landscaping. \na. The minimum setback and landscaping standards for exterior display areas and \nexterior storage are stated in Table 521-1. \nb. On sites with exterior display and storage as allowed by B.2, if the FAR on the site \nis less than 1:1, 15 percent of the site area must be landscaped. Landscaping \nmust comply with at least the L1 standard. Required landscaping for exterior \ndisplay, exterior storage, and parking areas may be counted in meeting this \nrequirement. \n4. Additional development standards for sites with exterior display or storage. \na. Walls of primary structures. This standard applies only in areas that allow \nexterior display and storage shown on Map 521-4. The street-facing façades of \nprimary structures must be within 24 feet of the street lot line. \nb. Main entrances. The main entrance must meet the standards of Section \n33.521.250, Entrances, except the entrance must be within 25 feet of the street \nit faces. \n \nTable 521-1 \nMinimum Setbacks and Landscaping for Exterior Display and Storage \n  \nLandscaped Setback  \n \nMinimum Landscaped Area \nExterior Display  \nIf between building and \nstreet and B.4.a is met \n \n \n \n \n0 ft  \nfrom street lot lines \n \n5 ft of L1  \nfrom nonstreet lot lines \n \n15% of exterior display area \nlandscaped to L1 standard. \nLandscaping in setbacks counts \ntoward meeting this standard. \nAll other situations \n \n5 ft of L1  \nfrom street lot lines [1] \n \n5 ft of L3  \nfrom nonstreet lot lines  \n15% of exterior display area \nlandscaped to L1 standard. \nLandscaping in setbacks counts \ntoward meeting this standard. \nExterior Storage 20 ft of L2  \nfrom transit streets [2] \n \n10 ft of L2 \nfrom other street lot lines [2] \n \n10 ft of L3 \nfrom nonstreet lot lines  \n15% of exterior storage area \nlandscaped to L1 standard. \nLandscaping in setbacks counts \ntoward meeting this standard. \n \nNotes: \n[1] Exterior display areas separated from the street by areas used for parking or exterior storage \ndo not have to meet this standard. \n[2] Exterior storage areas separated from the street by areas  used for parking or exterior display \ndo not have to meet this standard.  Chapter 33.521 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nEast Corridor Plan District 6/1/25 \n \n521-12 \nc. Exterior display between a building and a street. Exterior display areas may be \nbetween a primary structure that meets B.4.a, above, and a street if the \nfollowing are met: \n(1) The exterior display area must be accessible to pedestrians from the \nsidewalk for inspection of merchandise; \n(2) The exterior display area must be hard surfaced with unit paving blocks or \nbricks; and \n(3) Temporary signage and temporary advertising materials are prohibited in \nthe display area. \nd. Site frontage. No more than 70 percent of a site frontage on a transit street may \nbe used for vehicle areas, exterior storage areas, or exterior display areas. \nDisplay areas located between a building and street as allowed by B.4.c do not \ncount toward the 70 percent maximum. See Figure 521-3. \ne. Minimum floor area for sites with auto sales. For auto sales uses where exterior \ndisplay and exterior storage are allowed on all or part of the site by Paragraph \nB.2, the minimum required FAR is 0.4:1. Changes to existing auto sales uses with \nan FAR of less than 0.4:1 are allowed as specified in Chapter 33.258, \nNonconforming Situations. \nFigure 521-3 \nTransit Street Site Frontage for Exterior Display, Exterior Storage, and Vehicle Areas \n \n5. Nonconforming exterior display and exterior storage. Alterations to exterior display \nand exterior storage areas that are nonconforming because they are located where \nexterior display and exterior storage is prohibited are allowed as follows:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.521 \n6/1/25 East Corridor Plan District \n \n521-13 \na. The area that is nonconforming may be moved to another location on the site \nwhere exterior display and storage is prohibited if: \n(1) The square footage of nonconforming exterior display or storage is  \nnot increased; \n(2) The standards of Table 521-1 are met for the area that is moved; and \n(3) The change does not take the site out of conformance, or further out of \nconformance with B.4.d, site frontage. \nb. If the exterior display and exterior storage areas are not being moved, changes \nmay be made that bring the areas closer into conformance with this section. \nC. Residential development standards. When all the floor area on a site is in Residential uses, \nthe maximum setback from a street lot line is 20 feet. \nD. Retail Sales And Service and Office uses in the RM3 and RM4 zones. \n1. Purpose. This regulation provides opportunity for mixed use development in the RM3 \nand RM4 zones by allowing a limited amount of commercial use while ensuring that \ndevelopment in residential zones is predominately residential in character. \n2. Retail Sales And Service and Office uses are allowed in the RM3 and RM4 zones if they \nmeet the following regulations: \na. The total amount of Retail Sales And Service and Office use does not exceed \n2,000 square feet of net building area per use up to a total combined floor area \nratio of 0.4 to 1. More than than 2,000 square feet per use is prohibited, and \nmore than 0.4 to 1 total on the site is prohibited;  \nb. All of the gross building area that is in a Retail Sales And Service or Office use is \nlocated on the ground floor within 100 feet of a street lot line; and \nc. There are no exterior activities associated with the Retail Sales And Service or \nOffice use other than for outdoor seating. \nE. Vehicle Repair in the CM3 zone. \n1. Purpose. Vehicle Repair uses are limited in size to ensure that they will not dominate \nthe commercial area and to limit their potential impacts on residential and \ncommercial uses. \n2. No more than 30,000 square feet of net building area in Vehicle Repair uses is allowed \non a site. \nF. Motor vehicle fuel sales in the CM3 zone. \n1. Purpose. Auto-oriented uses are usually incompatible with an area that is intended to \nbe oriented towards transit and pedestrian travel. However, if developed in \nconjunction with other uses it may result in the consolidation of auto trips and may \nallow sites to be used more efficiently. Some of the negative impacts of such \ndevelopment may be mitigated by providing additional landscaping, both as a buffer  Chapter 33.521 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nEast Corridor Plan District 6/1/25 \n \n521-14 \nand to soften the entire site, and ensuring that other elements of design improve the \npedestrian environment. \n2. Motor vehicle fuel sales, including drive-through facilities associated with motor \nvehicle fuel sales, are allowed in the CM3 zone if the following are met. Drive-through \nfacilities serving or associated with other uses are prohibited: \na. The site must be at least 150,000 square feet in area, and have another primary \nuse on the site. The other primary use must be a Retail Sales And Service, and \nhave at least 50,000 square feet of net building area. \nb. Up to twelve fueling positions are allowed on a site. Fueling positions are the \nmaximum number of vehicles that can be fueled simultaneously. Therefore, 12 \nfueling positions would allow 12 cars to fuel at one time. \nc. The fuel pumps and any associated awning, canopy, or cover must be at least 20 \nfeet from street lot lines. Any portion of the 20-foot setback area that is not \noccupied by buildings that are enclosed on all sides must be landscaped to at last \nthe L2 standard. See Figure 521-4. Adjustments to this subparagraph are \nprohibited, but modifications may be requested through design review. \nd. The fuel pumps, stacking lanes, and any associated awning, canopy, or cover \nmust be at least 200 feet from the intersection of two transit streets. \nAdjustments to this standard are prohibited. \ne. Development on the site that does not comply with the development standards \nlisted below must be brought into conformance: \n(1) Landscaped setbacks for surface parking and exterior development areas; \n(2) Interior parking lot landscaping; and \n(3) Landscaping in existing building setbacks; \nf. The proposed development must be approved through design review; the Design \noverlay zone design standards in 33.420.050 may not be used.

As designated in the Outer Southeast Community Plan, \nthe Gateway Regional Center is targeted to receive a significant share of the city’s growth. Gateway \nis served by Interstates 205 and 84, MAX light rail, and TriMet bus service. At the crossroads of these \nmajor transportation facilities and high-quality transit service, Gateway is positioned to become the \nmost intensely developed area outside of the Central City. Future development will transform \nGateway from a suburban low density area to a dense, mixed-use regional center that maximizes \nthe public’s significant investment in the transportation infrastructure.  Chapter 33.526 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGateway Plan District 6/1/25 \n526-2 \nThe regulations of this chapter encourage the development of an urban level of housing, \nemployment, open space, public facilities, and pedestrian amenities that will strengthen the role of \nGateway as a regional center. The regulations also ensure that future development will provide for \ngreater connectivity of streets throughout the plan district. This development will implement the \nGateway Regional Center Policy of the Outer Southeast Community Plan. Together, the use and \ndevelopment regulations of the Gateway plan district: \n• Promote compatibility between private and public investments through building design and \nsite layout standards; \n• Promote new development and expansions of existing development that create attractive \nand convenient facilities for pedestrians and transit patrons to visit, live, work, and shop; \n• Ensure that new development moves the large sites in the plan district closer to the open \nspace and connectivity goals of the Gateway Regional Center; \n• Create a clear distinction and attractive transition between properties within the regional \ncenter and the more suburban neighborhoods outside; and \n• Provide opportunities for more intense mixed-use development around the light  \nrail stations. \n33.526.020 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to development in the Gateway plan district. The boundaries of \nthe plan district are shown on Map 526-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the Official  \nZoning Maps. \n33.526.030 Early Project Consultation \nApplicants are encouraged to meet with staff of the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, Portland \nPermitting & Development, the Portland Development Commission, the Portland Bureau of \nTransportation, and Portland Parks and Recreation three to six months before applying for a pre-\napplication conference or a land use review. This consultation provides an opportunity for both \nfunding and regulatory agencies to work closely with the property owner to determine the best \ncombination of plan, regulation, and urban renewal involvement to meet the fiscal needs and \nresponsibilities of the owner, accomplish public purposes, and leverage public dollars on behalf of \nnew development. \nUse Regulations \n33.526.100 Purpose \nThe use regulations of this chapter encourage uses that support transit patrons and pedestrians. \nThey do this by limiting auto-oriented uses and promoting small scale commercial development. \nSmall scale commercial development increases the variety and diversity of services and goods \navailable; helps reduce traffic congestion associated with large-scale retailers; enhances the mixed-\nuse character and pedestrian environment of the plan district; and improves the economic viability \nof higher density residential development. \n33.526.110 Additional Prohibited Uses \nA. Vehicle Repair, Quick Vehicle Servicing, Commercial Parking, and Self-Service Storage are \nprohibited in the plan district.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.526 \n6/1/25 Gateway Plan District \n \n526-3 \nB. Sale or lease of consumer vehicles, including passenger vehicles, motorcycles, light and \nmedium trucks, travel trailers, and other recreational vehicles is prohibited on the portion \nof a site within 200 feet of a light rail alignment. Offices for sale or lease of vehicles, where \nthe vehicles are displayed or stored elsewhere, are allowed. \n33.526.120 Retail Sales and Service and Office Uses \nA. On sites in the EX zone, Retail Sales And Services uses are allowed up to 5,000 square feet \nof net building area for each use. \nB. On sites in the EG1 zone, Retail Sales and Service uses are allowed up to 5,000 square feet \nof floor area for each use, up to a total of 20,000 square feet, or the square footage of the \nsite, whichever is less. \nC. On portions of sites zoned Institutional Residential, IR, and within 1000 feet of the Main \nStreet LRT Station, Retail Sales And Service uses are allowed up to 10,000 square feet of net \nbuilding area for each use. The Retail Sales And Service uses must be included in a \nConditional Use Master Plan or Impact Mitigation Plan for the site. Retail Sales And Service \nuses larger than 10,000 square feet of net building area for each use are prohibited. \nD. On sites in the RX zone, Retail Sales And Service and Office uses are allowed as follows. \nAdjustments to the regulations of this paragraph are prohibited. \n1. Commercial uses in new residential development. \na. Up to 40 percent of the net building area of a new residential building may be in \nRetail Sales And Service or Office uses. \nb. On the portion of a site within 1/4 mile of a Transit Station, up to 50 percent of \nthe net building area of a new residential building may be in Retail Sales And \nService or Office uses. \n2. Commercial uses in existing residential buildings. Up to 40 percent of existing net \nbuilding area in a building that is totally residential may be converted to Retail Sales \nAnd Service or Office uses. The conversion may not result in a net loss in the number \nof dwelling units on the site. \nDevelopment Standards \n33.526.200 Purpose. The development standards foster an intense mixed-use urban character with \na high quality pedestrian environment and an interconnected, dense street grid.  \nThey do this by: \n• Promoting the Enhanced Pedestrian Streets as the primary pedestrian routes in the plan \ndistrict and focusing more active uses and pedestrian amenities on these streets; \n• Increasing the development potential throughout the district and focusing the most intense \ndevelopment potential around the light rail stations; \n• Discouraging development, such as exterior display and storage and drive-throughs, that \nadversely affect the pedestrian environment; \n• Requiring larger sites within the plan district to provide connectivity, open space and a \nmixture of uses; and  Chapter 33.526 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGateway Plan District 6/1/25 \n526-4 \n• Ensuring an attractive transition between the higher density zones within the plan district \nand the adjacent single-dwelling residential zones. \n33.526.210 Building Height  \nA. Purpose. These regulations encourage intense development throughout the plan district, \nwith the highest level of intensity occurring around the light rail stations. This increased \ndevelopment opportunity reinforces Gateway’s role as a regional center. In addition, the \nregulations reduce adverse effects on adjacent single dwelling zones by creating a step-\ndown of building heights at the edge of the plan district. \nB. Maximum building height. The maximum building heights are shown on Map 526-2, except \nas specified in Subsection C. Except as follows, heights greater than shown on Map 526-2 \nare prohibited unless allowed by Section 33.526.230. Until January 2, 2032, adjustments to \nincrease the maximum building height may be requested for new buildings when at least \n75 percent of the total floor area is in a residential use. In this case, adjustments to \nincrease height by more than 20 percent of the maximum building height shown on Map \n526-2, or 10 feet, whichever is greater, are prohibited. \nC. Transition at edges of plan district. \n1. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this subsection apply to sites that \nhave a maximum building height of 75 feet or more and either: \na. Abut a site zones R7 through R2.5 that is not in the plan district; or \nb. Are across a Local Service Traffic Street from a site zoned R7 through R2.5 that is \nnot in the plan district. \n2. Abutting. Sites that abut a site zoned R7 through R2.5 have height limits that decrease \nin two steps, as follows. See Figure 526-1: \na. On the portion of the site within 25 feet of a site zoned R7 through R2.5, the \nmaximum building height is the same as the abutting residential zone; and \nb. On the portion of the site that is more than 25 feet but within 50 feet of a site \nzoned R7 through R2.5, the maximum building height is 50 feet. \n3. Across a street. Sites that are across a Local Service Traffic Street from a site zoned R7 \nthrough R2.5 have height limits that decrease in two steps, as follows.  \nSee Figure 526-1: \na. On the portion of the site within 25 feet of the street lot line, maximum building \nheight is the same as the residential zone across the street; and \nb. On the portion of the site that is more than 25 feet but within 50 feet of the \nstreet lot line, the maximum building height is 50 feet. \n33.526.220 Floor Area Ratio  \nA. Purpose. These regulations encourage intense development throughout the plan district \nwith a higher level of intensity occurring around light rail stations. This increased \ndevelopment reinforces Gateway’s role as a regional center. In addition, the standards \nensure a minimum level of development on some sites.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.526 \n6/1/25 Gateway Plan District \n \n526-5 \nB. Maximum floor area ratio. The maximum floor area ratios (FAR) allowed are shown on \nMap 526-3 at the end of this chapter. \nC. Minimum floor area ratio. The minimum floor area ratio (FAR) for new development is \nshown on Map 526-3. \nD. Limit on increased floor area. Increases in FAR, whether by transfers of floor area or bonus \nfloor area options, of more than 3 to 1 are prohibited. \nFigure 526-1 \nHeight Limits on Sites Abutting R7 – R2.5 Zones \n \n33.526.230 Floor Area and Height Bonus Options \nA. Purpose. Floor area and height bonus options are offered as incentives to encourage \nfacilities and amenities that are desired around the light rail stations and on sites with a \nGateway Master Plan. \nB. General regulations. \n1. Eligible sites. The inclusionary housing and Affordable Housing Fund bonus options \nmay be used in the multi-dwelling, commercial, EX, and CI2 zones in the Gateway plan \ndistrict. The other bonus options may be used only in areas shown on Map 526-5, and \non sites with a Gateway Master Plan.   Chapter 33.526 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGateway Plan District 6/1/25 \n526-6 \n2. New floor area. Only new floor area is eligible for the bonuses unless specifically \nstated otherwise. Exceptions to the requirements and the amount of bonus floor area \nor height earned are prohibited. \n3. Number of bonus options. Proposals may use more than one bonus option unless \nspecifically stated otherwise. Bonuses may be done in conjunction with allowed \ntransfers of floor area. \n4. Maximum floor area increase. The maximum floor area increase that may be earned \nthrough the bonus options must be within the limits for overall floor area increases \nstated in 33.526.220.D. \n5. Maximum height increase. Buildings using bonus floor area must not exceed the \nmaximum height limits shown on Map 526-2 unless eligible for bonus height. \nC. Bonus floor area options. Additional development potential in the form of floor area is \nearned for a project when the project includes any of the features listed below. The bonus \nfloor area amounts are additions to the maximum floor area ratios shown on Map 526-3. \n1. Mandatory inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR is allowed for development that triggers \n33.245, Inclusionary Housing. The amount of bonus floor area earned is an amount \nequal to the net building area of the building that triggers 33.245. To qualify for this \nbonus, the applicant must provide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau \ncertifying that the regulations of 33.245 have been met. \n2. Voluntary inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR is allowed when one of the following \nvoluntary bonus options is met: \na. Bonus FAR is allowed for projects that voluntarily comply with the standards of \n33.245.040 and 33.245.050. The amount of bonus floor area allowed is an \namount equal to the net building area of the building that complies with \n33.245.040 and .050. To qualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a \nletter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the regulations of 33.245 \nhave been met. The letter is required to be submitted before a building permit \ncan be issued for development, but is not required in order to apply for a land \nuse review; or \nb. Bonus FAR is allowed in exchange for payment into the Affordable Housing Fund. \nFor each square foot purchased a fee must be paid to the Portland Housing \nBureau (PHB). The Portland Housing Bureau collects and administers the \nAffordable Housing Fund, and PHB determines the fee per square foot and \nupdates the fee at least every three years. The fee schedule is available from \nPortland Permitting & Development. To qualify for this bonus option, the \napplicant must provide a letter from the PHB documenting the amount that has \nbeen contributed to the AHF. The letter is required to be submitted before a \nbuilding permit can be issued for the development, but it is not required in order \nto apply for a land use review. \n3. Open Space bonus option. Proposals that provide open space that may be used by the \npublic will receive bonus floor area. For each square foot of open space provided, a  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.526 \n6/1/25 Gateway Plan District \n \n526-7 \nbonus of one square foot of additional floor area is earned. To qualify for this bonus, \nthe following requirements must be met: \na. Size and dimensions. The open space must include at least 5,000 square feet of \ncontiguous area; \nb. Ownership and use. One of the following must be met: \n(1) The open space must be dedicated to the City, subject to paragraph 2.d.; or \n(2) A public access easement must be provided that allows for public access to \nand use of all the open space; \nc.

Parks approval. The applicant must submit with the application for land use \nreview a letter from Portland Parks and Recreation stating that the open space \nfeatures meet the requirements of the bureau, and that the space is acceptable \nto the bureau. \n4. Eco-roof bonus option. Eco-roofs are encouraged in the Gateway Regional Center \nbecause they reduce stormwater run-off, counter the increased heat of urban areas, \nand provide habitat for birds. An eco-roof is a rooftop stormwater facility that has \nbeen certified by the Bureau of Environmental Services (BES). \na. Bonus. Proposals that include eco-roofs receive bonus floor area as follows: \n(1) Where the total area of the eco-roof is at least 10 percent but less than 30 \npercent of the building’s footprint, each square foot of eco-roof earns one \nsquare foot of additional floor area. \n(2) Where the total area of the eco-roof is at least 30 percent but less than 60 \npercent of the building’s footprint, each square foot of eco-roof earns two \nsquare feet of additional floor area. \n(3) Where the total area of the eco-roof is at least 60 percent of the building’s \nfootprint, each square foot of eco-roof earns three square feet of additional \nfloor area. \nb. Before an application for a land use review will be approved, the applicant must \nsubmit a letter from BES certifying that BES approves the eco-roof. The letter \nmust also specify the area of the eco-roof. \nc. The property owner must execute a covenant with the City ensuring installation, \npreservation, maintenance, and replacement, if necessary, of the eco-roof. The \ncovenant must comply with the requirements of 33.700.060, Covenants  \nwith the City. \nD. General bonus heights. Bonus height is also earned in addition to the bonus floor area \nachieved through the bonus options. Bonus height is in addition to the maximum heights   Chapter 33.526 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGateway Plan District 6/1/25 \n526-8 \nof Map 526-2. The height bonus allowed is based on the floor area bonuses and transfers \nlisted in paragraph D.1., below. The amount of bonus height awarded is specified in \nparagraphs D.2. and D.3., below. \n1. The height bonus allowed is based on the floor area bonus options of Subsection \n33.526.230.C., above; \n2. In areas qualifying for a height bonus, on sites up to 40,000 square feet in area, the \namount of bonus height awarded is based on the following schedule: \na. For achieving a bonus floor area ratio of at least 1 to 1, but less than 2 to 1, a \nheight bonus of 15 feet is earned. \nb. For achieving a bonus floor area ratio of at least 2 to 1, but less than 3 to 1, a \nheight bonus of 30 feet is earned. \nc. For achieving a bonus floor area ratio of 3 to 1, a height bonus of 45 feet  \nis earned. \n3. In areas qualifying for a height bonus, on sites larger than 40,000 square feet in area, \nthe amount of bonus height awarded is based on the following schedule. The height \nbonus is applied only to the building where the bonus floor area is achieved or \ntransferred, not to the entire site: \na. For achieving bonus floor area of at least 20,000 square feet, but less than \n80,000 square feet, a height bonus of 15 feet is earned. \nb. For achieving bonus floor area of at least 40,000 square feet, but less than \n120,000 square feet, a height bonus of 30 feet is earned. \nc. For achieving bonus floor area of 80,000 square feet or more, a height bonus of \n45 feet is earned. \nE. Bonus height option for housing. \n1. Generally. In the areas eligible for bonus height shown on Map 526-5, building heights \nmay be allowed to be greater than shown on Map 526-2 if the bonus height is for \nhousing. \n2. Standard. The maximum height bonus that may be allowed is 75 feet. Projects may \nuse both the bonus height options of this subsection and Subsection D., above. \nHowever, if both options are used, the combined bonus height may not exceed 75 \nfeet. Bonus height in excess of the maximum allowed through Subsection D., above, \nmust be exclusively for housing. \n3. Approval criteria. The approval of the bonus height is made as part of the design \nreview of the project. The bonus height will be approved if the review body finds that \nthe applicant has shown that the following criteria have been met: \na. If the site is within 500 feet of an R zone, the proposed building will not cast \nshadows that have significant negative impacts on dwelling units in the  \nR zone; and  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.526 \n6/1/25 Gateway Plan District \n \n526-9 \nb. The increased height will result in a project that better meets the applicable \ndesign guidelines. \n33.526.240 Open Area \nA. Purpose. The open area requirement ensures provision of adequate amounts of open area, \nincluding light and air, for those who live, work and visit the Gateway plan district. Open \narea can provide passive or active recreational opportunities, and help to soften the built \nenvironment. In order to provide flexibility, this provision allows the requirement to be met \nby phasing the open area, locating it off site, or paying into a fund. \nB. Calculations. For purposes of this section, site area dedicated for public right-of-way is \nsubtracted from the total site or lot area; \nC. Where these regulations apply. The requirements of this section apply to sites 5 acres or \nmore in area. \nD. Additions of floor area to the site. The requirements of this subsection apply to sites \nwhere the proposal will result in an increase of at least 10,000 square feet of floor area on \nthe site. The applicant may choose from the three options below: \n1. On-site option. If the open area will be on-site, the following standards must be met: \na. At least 0.5 square foot of open area is required for each square foot of floor \narea proposed for the site, up to a maximum requirement of 15 percent of the \nsite area. Adjustments to reduce the total required amount of open area by up to \n25 percent may be requested prior to January 2, 2032. Beginning January 2, \n2032, adjustments to this standard are prohibited. \nb. Open areas are parks; plazas; or other similar areas approved through design \nreview. These areas may include improvements such as children’s play \nequipment, picnic areas, landscaping, benches, paved walkways or trails, \ngardens, organized sport fields or courts, or other outdoor amenities. Open areas \ndo not include areas used for parking or loading, or landscaping within parking \nareas. \nc. Existing open areas on the site may be used to meet this requirement. Open \nareas used for stormwater management or required recreation area may also be \nused to meet the requirements of this section. Open areas used to earn bonus \nfloor area may not be used to meet the requirements of this section. \nd. The open area must be located outdoors on the site and abut either the public \nsidewalk or the site’s pedestrian circulation system. \ne. Open area may be provided in a variety of sizes, but each open area must \nmeasure at least 20 feet in all directions. \nf. The application must identify the location, proposed improvements, and timing \nof the improvements. \n2. Off-site option. If the open area will be off-site, the following standards must be met: \na.

At least 0.5 square foot of open area is required for each square foot of floor \narea proposed for the site, up to a maximum requirement of 15 percent of the \nsite area. Adjustments to reduce the total required amount of open area by up to \n25 percent may be requested prior to January 2, 2032. Beginning January 2, \n2032, adjustments to this standard are prohibited. \nc. The application must identify when the proposed open area site will be \ntransferred into the ownership of the Portland Bureau of Parks and Recreation. \n3. Gateway Regional Center Public Open Area Fund option. As an alternative to \ndeveloping open area, the applicant may pay $30.00 per required square foot of open \narea into the Gateway Regional Center Public Open Area Fund (Open Area Fund). The \nOpen Area Fund is collected and administered by the Portland Bureau of Parks and \nRecreation. The funds collected must be used within the Gateway plan district, either \nfor acquisition or improvement of public open areas. If using this option, the following \nmust be met: \na. The required square footage of open area is calculated as 0.5 square foot of open \narea for each square foot of floor area proposed for the site, up to a maximum \nrequirement of 15 percent of the site area; \nb. When applying for building permits or land use reviews on the site, the applicant \nmust submit with the application a letter from the Portland Bureau of Parks and \nRecreation documenting the amount that has been contributed to the Open Area \nFund. \nE. Land divisions. The standards and approval criteria of this subsection apply to sites where a \nland division is proposed: \n1. The regulations of this subsection do not apply to proposed lots 5 acres or more in \narea. The regulations will apply if such lots are divided further. \n2. The regulations of this paragraph apply to proposed lots less than 5 acres in area. \na. For each lot, an area equal to at least 15 percent of the area of the lot must be in \nopen area. \nb. For each lot, the applicant may choose to locate the required amount of open \narea on the lot, elsewhere on the land division site, or off-site. The applicant may \nalso choose to make a contribution to the Open Area Fund. The application must \nspecify which of these options, or combination of options, will be used to meet \nthe requirements of this subsection. \n(1) If the open area requirement will be met on the lot, the applicant must \nspecify the location.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.526 \n6/1/25 Gateway Plan District \n \n526-11 \n(2) If the open area requirement will be met elsewhere on the land division \nsite, the required area must be in a tract. \n(3) If the open area requirement will be met off-site or through a contribution \nto the Open Area Fund, the requirements of Paragraphs D.2 or D.3 must  \nbe met: \nc. If the requirements of this paragraph will be met on the land division site or on \nthe lot, the applicant must indicate when improvements will be made to the \nopen area, what the extent of the improvements will be, and who will be \nresponsible for the improvements and maintenance of the improvements. The \nfollowing additional approval criteria must also be met: \n(1) Location. Each open area must be located on a part of the site that can be \nreasonably developed to meet requirements of Subparagraphs D.1.b. \nthrough D.1.e; \n(2) Improvements. The proposed improvements must be consistent with the \npurpose of this section; and \n(3) Timing. The timing of the improvements must be reasonably related to the \ntiming of other development on the site. \n33.526.250 Connectivity \nA. Purpose. The connectivity requirement ensures that adequate street and \npedestrian/bicycle connections will be provided for local access to development and access \nfor emergency vehicles. This regulation implements the Gateway Master Street Plan and \nimproves vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle circulation throughout the plan district, while \nminimizing congestion on the arterial system. Where full street connections are not \nfeasible, pedestrian and bicycle connections provide access for those most sensitive to the \nlack of direct connections. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The requirements of this section apply to all sites in the \nplan district. \nC. Requirements. \n1. The Portland Bureau of Transportation determines the location and widths of rights-\nof-way and extent and timing of street improvements based on the Gateway Master \nStreet Plan in the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan. \n2. Proposed development that may obstruct new street alignments as identified in the \nGateway Master Street Plan is regulated by Chapter 17.88. \n33.526.260 Pedestrian Standards \nA. Purpose. These regulations ensure direct pedestrian connections between the street and \nbuildings on a site and between buildings and other activities within the site. Together with \nthe Enhanced Pedestrian Street, entrance, and ground floor window regulations, the \npedestrian standards ensure that the sidewalks in the plan district, especially on Enhanced \nPedestrian Streets, are convenient, active, pleasant environments with pedestrian \namenities.  Chapter 33.526 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGateway Plan District 6/1/25 \n526-12 \nB. Standards. \n1. All sites in the plan district are subject to the Pedestrian Standards of Paragraph \n33.130.240.B.1. through 3. \n2. Generally, development must meet either B.2.a. or B.2.b. On sites with frontage on an \nEnhanced Pedestrian Street shown on Map 526-4, standard B.2.b. must be met along \nthe Enhanced Pedestrian Street frontage, except where there has been a school use \non the site since 2004, in which case either B.2.a. or B.2.b. can be met. \na. Landscaped. A landscape buffer must be provided when a building or exterior \nimprovement is setback at least 5 feet from a street lot line. The entire area \nbetween the building or exterior improvement and the street lot line must be \nlandscaped to meet the L1 standard in Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and \nScreening; \nb. Hard-surfaced. The area between a building or exterior improvement and a \nstreet lot line must be hard-surfaced and developed for use by pedestrians, \noutdoor seating for restaurants, or pedestrian-oriented accessory activities \nincluding stands selling flowers, food or drinks. If the area is greater than three \nfeet deep, then the area must contain amenities such as benches, trees (tree \nwells with grates are exempt from the hard-surface requirement), drinking \nfountains, planters, and kiosks. At least one of these amenities must be provided \nfor each 100 square feet of pedestrian use area in the setback. \n3. Bicycle parking may be located in the area between a building and a street lot line. \n33.526.270 Entrances \nA. Purpose. These regulations ensure that at least one main entrance into a building, and \neach tenant space in a building that faces a street, be oriented to public streets or the light \nrail alignment. This requirement enhances pedestrian access from the sidewalk to adjacent \nbuildings. Together with the Enhanced Pedestrian Street, ground floor window, and \npedestrian standards, the entrance standards ensure that the sidewalks in the plan district \nare convenient, active, pleasant environments with pedestrian amenities. \nB. Where these regulations apply. In RM2, RM3, RM4, RX, C, E, and CI zones, buildings must \nmeet the standards of Subsection C., below. \nC. Entrances. For portions of a building within the maximum building setback, at least one \nmain entrance for each nonresidential tenant space on the ground floor must meet the \nstandards of this section. The ground floor is the lowest floor of the building that is within \nfour feet of the adjacent street grade. Entrances that open into lobbies, reception areas, or \ncommon interior circulation space must also meet the standards of this section. The  \nentrances must: \n1. Face a public street or light rail alignment; \n2. Be within 15 feet of the public street or light rail alignment it faces; \n3. Be oriented to nearby transit facilities as follows:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.526 \n6/1/25 Gateway Plan District \n \n526-13 \na. If a site abuts a light rail alignment along East Burnside Street, the main entrance \nmust orient to that alignment. If the proposed building is within 100 feet of a \ntransit station, at least one entrance must be along the first 25 feet of the wall \nnearest the station. \nb. If a site abuts a transit street other than a light rail alignment, the entrance must \norient to that street. \nc. If the site abuts intersecting transit streets, the main entrance must orient to the \nstreet with the highest classification. \nd. If the site abuts intersecting transit streets with the same classification, the \nentrance may be at a 45 degree angle to both streets or within 25 feet of the \ncorner along either transit street. \n33.526.280 Enhanced Pedestrian Street Standards \nA. Purpose. These regulations enhance and ensure the continuity of the pedestrian \nenvironment along key streets in the Gateway plan district. The standards help maintain an \nurban character along the Enhanced Pedestrian Streets by reinforcing the continuity of \npedestrian-oriented, active ground-level uses and strengthening the relationship between \nthose uses and the pedestrian environment. Active uses include but are not limited to: \nlobbies, retail, residential, commercial, and office. Together with the ground floor window, \nentrance, and pedestrian standards, the Enhanced Pedestrian Street standards foster an \nefficient, safe, and interesting route for pedestrians to move through the Gateway  \nplan district. \nB. Where these regulations apply. Except as follows, the standards of this section apply to \nnew development and alterations to existing development that add at least 40,000 square \nfeet of net building area on sites that abut an Enhanced Pedestrian Street shown on Map \n526-4. The following are exempt from the standards. \n1. Development in the RM1, RM2, and RM3 zones; \n2. Development where there has been a school use on the site since June 18, 2004; and \n3. Accessory structures. \nC. Required building lines. Either Paragraph C.1. or C.2., must be met. This standard only \napplies along the Enhanced Pedestrian Street. Exterior walls of buildings designed to meet \nthe requirements of this subsection must be at least 15 feet high. Sites where this standard \napplies are exempt from the maximum building setbacks of the base zone. \n1. The building must extend to the street lot line along at least 75 percent of the  \nlot line; or \n2. The building must extend to within 12 feet of the street lot line for 75 percent of the \nlot line and the space between the building and the street lot line must be designed as \nan extension of the sidewalk and committed to active uses such as sidewalk cafes or \nvendor’s stands. \nD. Ground floor active uses. Buildings must be designed and constructed to accommodate \nuses such as those listed in Subsection A, above. Areas designed to accommodate these  Chapter 33.526 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGateway Plan District 6/1/25 \n526-14 \nuses may be developed at the time of construction, or may be designed for later \nconversion to active uses. This standard must be met along at least 50 percent of the \nground floor of walls that are at an angle of 45 degrees or less from the street lot line of an \nEnhanced Pedestrian Street, a plaza, or other public open space. Areas designed to \naccommodate active uses must meet the following standards. Development that includes a \nresidential use is exempt from the ground floor active use standard until January 1, 2029: \n1. The distance from the finished floor to the bottom of the structure above must be at \nleast 12 feet. The bottom of the structure above includes supporting beams; \n2. The area must be at least 25 feet deep, measured from the street-facing facade or \nwall; \n3. The area may be designed to accommodate a single tenant or multiple tenants; \n4. The street-facing façade must include windows, or be structurally designed so doors \nand windows can be added when the space is converted to active building uses; and \n5. Parking is not allowed in the areas that are required to meet the standard of  \nthis subsection. \n33.526.290 Ground Floor Windows \nA. Purpose. In the Gateway plan district, blank walls on the ground level of buildings are \nlimited in order to: \n• Provide a pleasant, rich, and diverse pedestrian experience by connecting activities \noccurring within a structure to adjacent sidewalk areas; \n• Encourage continuity of retail and service uses; \n• Encourage surveillance opportunities by restricting fortress-like facades at street  \nlevel; and \n• Avoid a monotonous pedestrian environment. \nB. Standard. All exterior walls on the ground level that face a street lot line, sidewalk, plaza, \nor other public open space or right-of-way must meet the Ground Floor Window \nrequirements of the CX zone. \n33.526.300 Required Windows Above the Ground Floor \nA. Purpose. These regulations prevent large blank walls above the ground floor from facing \nresidential sites outside the plan district. Together with the height regulations, this helps \nlessen the impact of tall buildings in the regional center on adjacent  \nresidential neighborhoods. \nB. Required windows above the ground floor. Sites across a street and within 50 feet of R7 \nthrough R2.5 zones outside the plan district must provide windows in façades that face a \nresidential zone. The windows must cover at least 15 percent of the area of the façade \nabove the ground level. This requirement is in addition to any required ground  \nfloor windows.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.526 \n6/1/25 Gateway Plan District \n \n526-15 \n33.526.310 Exterior Display and Storage \nExterior display and storage are prohibited except for outdoor seating for restaurants and \npedestrian-oriented accessory uses, including flower, food, or drink stands. Temporary open-air \nmarkets and carnivals are also allowed. \n33.526.320 Drive-Through Facilities \nDrive-through facilities are prohibited. \n33.526.330 Gateway Master Plan \nA. Purpose. The Gateway master plan adds development potential and flexibility for projects \nin specified areas. A carefully considered master plan has the potential to ensure that new \ndevelopment moves sites in the plan district closer to the goals of the Gateway Regional \nCenter, while allowing for flexibility, additional development capacity, and phasing of \nchange. The additional development potential and flexibility are possible because the  \nmaster plan demonstrates that the policy objectives of the Outer Southeast Community \nPlan are advanced and can be met in the long term. The Gateway master plan is an option; \nit is not a requirement. \nB. Flexibility achieved. An approved Gateway master plan allows additional flexibility in any \nof the following situations: \n1. Allocates allowed floor area to individual development sites that will not remain in the \nsame ownership; \n2. Allows uses to be arranged on the site in the most appropriate manner by allowing \nuses to be located in zones where they are otherwise not permitted, except that \nhousehold living is prohibited in EG zones. \n3. Allows the development of required housing at an alternate location; \n4. Defers the building of required open area; \n5. Defers the construction of required streets, accessways, and other transportation \nelements; or \n6. Allows applicants to take advantage of bonus options in 33.526.230.  \nC. Contents of a Gateway master plan. In addition to the application requirements of Section \n33.730.060, a Gateway master plan must contain the components listed below. The greater \nthe level of detail in the plan, the less need for extensive reviews of subsequent phases. \nConversely, the more general the details, the greater the level of review that will be \nrequired for subsequent phases. The plan must include: \n1. Floor area. How allowable floor area will be distributed throughout the site. This can \nbe shown by location of buildings, by subareas of the site, or by amount assigned to \neach lot. Floor area may be reallocated within the site. \n2. Location of uses. The location of proposed uses on the site. If a use is allowed on the \nsite, it may be located on a portion of the site where the zoning would otherwise not \npermit it. Regardless of use, the base zone development standards will apply.  Chapter 33.526 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGateway Plan District 6/1/25 \n526-16 \n3. Housing. \na. The location, density, and general type of housing to be built. If residential \ndevelopment is required by the base zone, the plan must show how the \nrequirement will be met. \nb. If the required housing is proposed for a location outside of the residentially-\nzoned area, the proposed site must meet the following requirements. The site \nmust be under the applicant’s control. The site must be vacant or used for \nsurface parking, or have improvements with an assessed value less than one-\nthird the value of the land. The site must be within the Gateway plan district and \nbe zoned CX or EX. The proposed housing site must be of suitable size and \nlocation to be attractive for the required amount of housing. \n4. Minimum and maximum requirements. The total combined floor area for the entire \nsite and for each use must be within the minimum required and maximum allowed, \nincluding bonus floor area, for the plan area. Floor area transfers outside of the \nGateway master plan site are prohibited. \n5. Infrastructure capability. The plan must identify and link the development of each \nphase of the project to the provision of services necessary to meet the infrastructure \nservice needs of the development associated with that phase. \n6. Circulation. The plan must identify a clear internal circulation system that joins the \nsurrounding street system at logical points and meets the needs of pedestrians, \nbicyclists, and drivers. \n7. Open area. The plan must identify when and where the open area will be built. \n8. Connectivity. The plan must identify when and where the streets, accessways, and \nother internal connections will be built. \n9. Proposed reviews and criteria. Required reviews, such as design and other land use \nreviews, for all phases may be done as part of the initial master plan review, or may be \ndone separately at the time of each new phase of development. \na. If the applicant requests that all of the required reviews be done as part of the \nreview of the master plan, the plan must explain and provide enough detail on \nhow the proposals comply with the approval criteria for the reviews. \nb. If the applicant decides to defer these reviews to the time of future \ndevelopment, the plan must specify what review procedures and approval \ncriteria will be used for reviewing that development. \nc. Adjustments and modifications. If any adjustments or modifications are being \nrequested in conjunction with the Gateway master plan review, the application \nmust include a statement as to how each adjustment and modification complies \nwith the approval criteria for the adjustment or modification. \nD. Duration and expiration of a Gateway master plan. \n1. A Gateway master plan must include currently proposed developments and \ndevelopments that might be proposed within at least 3 years.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.526 \n6/1/25 Gateway Plan District \n \n526-17 \n2. An approved Gateway master plan remains in effect until development allowed by the \nplan has been completed, the plan is amended or superseded, or it becomes void as \nspecified in Paragraph D.3., below. \n3. If there has been no development on the site within 10 years after the Gateway \nmaster plan is approved, the Gateway master plan is void, and no further \ndevelopment will be allowed on any area previously covered by the plan until a new \nor updated plan is approved. \nE. Implementation. \n1. Development in conformance with a Gateway master plan. \na. Development that is consistent with and conforms to the specific Gateway \nmaster plan is not required to go through another Gateway master plan review, \nbut may be subject to additional reviews specified by the plan. \nb. Any transportation, water, stormwater disposal, or wastewater disposal systems \nidentified in the plan as necessary to serve the development are in place or will \nbe in place when the project is ready for occupancy. \n2. Development not in conformance with Gateway master plan. Development that is not \nin conformance with the Gateway master plan requires an amendment to the plan. \n33.526.340 Parking \nA. Purpose. The regulations of this section ensure that development is oriented to transit, \nbicycling, and pedestrian travel while ensuring accessibility for motor vehicles. Limiting the \nnumber of parking spaces promotes efficient use of land, enhances urban form, encourages \nuse of alternative modes of transportation, provides for a better pedestrian environment, \nand protects air and water quality. Parking that is provided in structures is preferred over \nparking in surface lots because, as a more efficient use of land, structured parking \npromotes compact urban development. In addition, parking structures with active uses on \nthe ground floor provide a better environment for pedestrians and contribute to the \ncontinuity of street-level retail and service uses that support a thriving urban area. \n Limiting the location of parking and access on light rail alignments improves access to \ntransit, supports a transit-oriented development pattern, and reduces conflicts between \nmotor vehicles and pedestrians or bicycles. In particular, it reduces conflicts between \nmotor vehicles and light rail trains, especially where the access would require cars to cross \nthe light rail tracks. \nB. Maximum allowed parking spaces.  \n1. Maximum allowed parking spaces. Except as specified in B.2., the maximum number \nof parking spaces allowed for nonresidential uses is 150 percent of Standard A in Table \n266-2 of Chapter 33.266, Parking, Loading, and Transportation and Parking Demand \nManagement. The maximums apply to both surface and structured parking. \n \n \n  Chapter 33.526 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGateway Plan District 6/1/25 \n526-18 \n2. Exceptions. \na. Medical and dental offices. The maximum number of parking spaces allowed for \nmedical and dental offices is 1 space per 200 square feet of net building area. \nThe maximum applies to both surface and structured parking. \nb. Office uses. If all of the parking accessory to Office uses is in structured parking, \nthe maximum number of parking spaces allowed for Office uses is 1 space per \n300 square feet of net building area. \nc. Park-and-ride facilities. There is no maximum for park-and-ride facilities. \nC. Location. \n1. Vehicle areas are not allowed between a primary structure and any street, except  \nas follows: \na. Sites with through lots or with three frontages may have vehicle areas between a \nprimary structure and one Local Service Transit Street. \nb. Sites on full blocks may have vehicle areas between a primary structure and two \nLocal Service Transit Streets. \nc. Driveways are allowed between a building and a street that is not a light rail \nalignment if the driveway provides a straight line connection between a street \nand parking area inside the building. Driveways between a building and a light \nrail alignment are not allowed. \n2. Vehicle areas are not allowed on the portion of the site within 100 feet of a street that \nis a light rail alignment. \nD. Structured parking near light rail. In C and E zones, areas of structured parking located \nwithin 100 feet of a light rail alignment must meet the standards of 33.526.280.D.1. \nthrough D.5, along at least 50 percent of the structure’s ground floor walls that face the \nlight rail alignment and face a sidewalk, plaza, or other public open space. \n \n(Added by Ord.

The plan district’s large number of well-\nestablished industrial firms are dependent on the area’s multimodal transportation system, \nincluding marine, rail, and trucking facilities, and on the ability of area streets to accommodate truck \nmovements. Because of its proximity to inner-city neighborhoods with high concentrations of \ncommercial and residential uses, the Guild’s Lake Industrial Sanctuary is particularly vulnerable to \nimpacts from, and redevelopment to, nonindustrial uses. The provisions of the plan district \nrecognize that the displacement of industrial uses by inappropriate nonindustrial uses potentially \nthreatens the integrity of this district and investments in public and private infrastructure. The \nprovisions of this chapter protect the area from incompatible uses which threaten the district's \nintegrity, stability and vitality and compromise its transportation system.  \n33.531.020 Where the Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to sites in the Guild’s Lake Industrial Sanctuary plan district. \nThe boundaries of the plan district are shown on Map 531-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the \nOfficial Zoning Maps. The boundaries of the subdistricts are also shown on Map 531-1. \nUse Regulations \n33.531.100 Purpose \nNonindustrial uses in the plan district are limited because they interfere with industrial activities and \ngenerate traffic that can compromise the ability of the area’s multimodal transportation system to \nserve industrial uses. These restrictions ensure that the plan district is preserved primarily for \nindustrial uses, while allowing limited commercial uses that serve industrial firms and their \nemployees. The restrictions are most extensive in the IH zone; in that zone the potential for conflicts \nbetween industrial and nonindustrial uses is greatest because of the nature of heavy industrial \noperations. Greater flexibility is provided for nonindustrial uses along portions of the plan district’s \nsouthern boundary, together with additional development standards, to address the close interface \nof industrial operations and mixed-use areas along NW Vaughn Street.  Chapter 33.531 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGuild’s Lake Industrial Sanctuary Plan District  6/1/25 \n \n531-2 \n33.531.110 Additional Use Limitations in the IH Zone \nA. Purpose. These regulations place additional limitations on commercial uses to minimize \ntheir impact on industrial activity. In addition, the regulations place limits on accessory and \nheadquarters offices in the core of the plan district to ensure that the offices will be clearly \nsubordinate to their associated uses and to limit their potential impacts on nearby \nindustrial operations. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to sites in the  \nIH zone. \nC. Retail Sales And Service and Office uses in the IH zone. \n1. Limited uses. Up to four Retail Sales And Service and Office uses are allowed per site. \nThe square footage of the net building area plus the exterior display and storage area \nmay be up to 3,000 square feet per use. \n2. Conditional uses. \na. More than four Retail Sales And Service or Office uses on a site is a  \nconditional use. \nb. Any Retail Sales And Service or Office use where the net building area plus the \nexterior display and storage area is more than 3,000 square feet is a conditional \nuse. Except for sites with a historic landmark, the net building area of all the \nRetail Sales And Service or Office uses on a site plus the exterior display and \nstorage area, taken together, may not exceed 10,000 square feet or the square \nfootage of the site area, whichever is less. For sites with a historic landmark, the \nnet building area of all the Retail Sales And Service and Office uses on a site plus \nthe exterior display and storage area, taken together, may not exceed 25,000 \nsquare feet or twice the square footage of the site area, whichever is less. \nExceptions to these size limits are prohibited. \nD. Accessory Offices and Headquarters Offices. Up to 25 percent of the net building area plus \nexterior work and storage areas on a site, or 25,000 square feet, whichever is less, may be \nin accessory office or headquarters office use. Accessory or headquarters office uses that \nexceed this percentage, or occupy more than 25,000 square feet, are a conditional use. \nAccessory and headquarters offices are allowed only in conjunction with a primary use that \nis allowed in the zone or has been approved as a conditional use. \n33.531.120 Additional Prohibited Uses \nA. Purpose. To preserve the Guild’s Lake area as a suitable location for industrial uses, these \nregulations prohibit nonindustrial uses that conflict with industrial activities and that can \ncontribute to traffic congestion, especially in the core of the plan district. \nB. Additional prohibited uses in the IH zone. The following uses are prohibited in the \nIH zone: \n1. Household Living; \n2. Self-Service Storage;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.531 \n6/1/25  Guild’s Lake Industrial Sanctuary Plan District \n \n531-3 \n3. Commercial Outdoor Recreation; and \n4. Major Event Entertainment. \nC. Additional prohibited uses in the IG zones. The following uses are prohibited in the  \nIG zones: \n1. Household Living; \n2. Commercial Outdoor Recreation; and \n3. Major Event entertainment. \n33.531.130 Additional Regulations in Subdistrict A \nSites in Subdistrict A are also subject to the regulations of the following Sections of the Northwest \nHills Plan District: 33.563.200 Prohibition, 33.563.210 Additional Approval Criteria, and 33.563.030, \nTransfer of Development Rights. \n \n(Added by: Ord.

Chapter 33.532 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHayden Island Plan District 3/1/20 \n \n532-2 \n33.532.020 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to the Hayden Island plan district. The boundaries of the plan \ndistrict and subdistrict are shown on Map 532-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the Official Zoning \nMaps. \n33.532.030 Application of Regulations Relating to Future Rights-of-Way and Transit Stations \nRegulations of this chapter that are based on the location of a right-of-way or Transit Station apply \nas follows: \nA. If the right-of-way or Transit Station has been improved or dedicated, the regulation \napplies based on the actual location of the right-of-way, tract, or easement. \nB. If the right-of-way or Transit Station has not been improved or dedicated, the regulation \napplies based on the location of the right-of-way or Transit Station as shown on the Master \nStreet Plan for the area that has been accepted by City Council. The multi-modal street plan \nis maintained by the Portland Bureau of Transportation and is documented in the \nTransportation Element of Portland’s Comprehensive Plan. \nDevelopment Standards \n33.532.110 Additional Regulations in the Open Space Zone \nA.  Purpose. More intense activities may be appropriate in OS-zoned sites near the Transit \nStation. Allowing these uses can both provide space for outdoor activities that are \nappropriate in an urban setting, and increase desirable activity within and near open space. \nB.  Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to sites in the OS zone \nthat are within 1,500 feet of the Transit Station. \nC.  Retail Sales And Service. \n1. Up to 10,000 square feet of net building area in Retail Sales And Service uses or 10 \npercent of the area of the site, whichever is less, may be requested through a \nConditional Use Review. This maximum applies to the cumulative net building area of \nall Retail Sales And Service uses on a site. \n2.  Maximum parking. The maximum parking allowed for Retail Sales And Service uses is 1 \nspace per 250 square feet of net building area. \n33.532.210 Maximum Building Height \nA.  Purpose. The regulations of this section: \n• Allow taller buildings near the Light Rail Station to encourage mixed-use and transit-\noriented development; \n• Increase opportunities for creative design to encourage development of interesting \nbuildings that help create a sense of place; \n• Recognize the prominent location of Hayden Island as a gateway to Oregon and the \npotential for visually interesting development to welcome visitors and residents, while \nmitigating for potential impacts through excellent design, articulation and step-backs, \nand the use of quality materials.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.532 \n1/1/25 Hayden Island Plan District \n \n532-3 \nB.  Maximum building heights. \n1.  Generally. The maximum building heights are shown on Map 532-2. \n2.  Height Opportunity Areas. In the Height Opportunity Areas shown on Map 532-2: \na.  Height may be increased to 90 feet if the maximum building coverage is 20 \npercent or less; \nb.  Height may be increased to 80 feet if the maximum building coverage is 25 \npercent or less; \nc.  Except as follows, adjustments and modifications to the standards of this \nparagraph are prohibited. Until January 2, 2032, adjustments to the height \nopportunity area height limits shown on Map 532-2 may be requested for new \nbuildings when at least 75 percent of the total floor area is in a residential use. In \nthis case, adjustments to increase the height opportunity area height limit by \nmore than 20 percent of the maximum building height shown on Map 532-2, or \n10 feet, whichever is greater, are prohibited. \n3.  Jantzen Beach subdistrict. In the Jantzen Beach subdistrict, adjustment may be \nrequested to increase height to the maximum height limit shown on Map 532-2. \nHeights above the maximum height limit shown on Map 532-2 are prohibited. \n33.532.220 Minimum and Maximum Floor Area \nA.  Purpose. These regulations encourage dense, mixed-use development in the pedestrian \ndistrict, and reinforce the Jantzen Beach subdistrict as a transit-supportive,  \nmixed-use neighborhood. \nB.  Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this Subsection apply in the Jantzen \nBeach subdistrict. \nC.  Maximum FAR in the Jantzen Beach subdistrict \n1.  In the Jantzen Beach subdistrict, the maximum FAR is .75 to 1. Floor area used for \nparking is not counted toward maximum FAR. Transfers of floor area between the \nWest and East subareas are prohibited. \n2.  Inclusionary housing bonuses.  The following inclusionary housing bonus options are \nallowed. An increase in FAR of more than 3 to 1 on a site that is outside the pedestrian \ndistrict is not allowed. An increase in FAR of more than .75 to 1 on a site that is inside \nthe pedestrian district is not allowed. \na. Mandatory inclusionary housing bonus option. Bonus FAR is allowed for \ndevelopment that triggers 33.245, Inclusionary Housing. The amount of bonus \nfloor area earned is an amount equal to the net building area of the building that \ntriggers 33.245. To qualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a letter \nfrom the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the regulations of 33.245 have \nbeen met.  \nb. Voluntary inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR is allowed when one of the following \nvoluntary bonus options is met:  Chapter 33.532 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHayden Island Plan District 1/1/25 \n \n532-4 \n(1) Bonus FAR is allowed for projects that voluntarily comply with the standards \nof 33.245.040 and 33.245.050. The amount of bonus floor area allowed is an \namount equal to the net building area of the building that complies with \n33.245.040 and .050. To qualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a \nletter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the regulations of \n33.245 have been met. The letter is required to be submitted before a \nbuilding permit can be issued for development, but is not required in order \nto apply for a land use review; or \n(2) Bonus FAR is allowed in exchange for payment into the Affordable Housing \nFund. For each square foot purchased a fee must be paid to the Portland \nHousing Bureau (PHB). The Portland Housing Bureau collects and \nadministers the Affordable Housing Fund, and PHB determines the fee per \nsquare foot and updates the fee at least every three years. The fee schedule \nis available from Portland Permitting & Development. To qualify for this \nbonus option, the applicant must provide a letter from the PHB \ndocumenting the amount that has been contributed to the AHF. The letter is \nrequired to be submitted before a building permit can be issued for the \ndevelopment, but it is not required in order to apply for a land use review. \nD.  Minimum FAR in Jantzen Beach subdistrict.  \n1.  Purpose. These regulations ensure that development is distributed throughout the \nJantzen Beach subdistrict to maximize the positive benefits of pedestrian-friendly, \nproperly-scaled development without the negative impacts of over-sized buildings \nsurrounded by large surface parking lots. \n2.  West subarea. In the West subarea, the minimum amount of the West subarea that \nmust be covered with buildings is 300,000 square feet. \n3.  East subarea. In the East subarea, the amount of East subarea that must be covered \nwith buildings is 300,000 square feet. \nE.  Adjustments to maximum floor area or maximum FAR. Adjustments to the maximum floor \narea or FAR regulations of this Chapter must meet the following approval criterion in \naddition to the approval criteria of Chapter 33.805: The transportation system is capable of \nsupporting the proposal in addition to the existing uses in the area. Evaluation factors \nincluding capacity of Interstate 5 on and off ramps on Hayden Island. \nF.  Land Divisions in the Jantzen Beach Subdistrict. \n1.  Supplemental application requirement. Applications for land divisions in the Jantzen \nBeach subdistrict must specify how the minimum and maximum floor area required by \nthis chapter will be allocated to each lot, parcel, and tract. \n2.  Supplemental approval criterion. The allocation of minimum and maximum floor area \nto each lot, parcel, and tract must be found to still meet the requirements of  \nthis chapter. \n3.  The applicant must execute a covenant with the City which is attached to and \nrecorded with the deed of each lot, parcel, and tract. The covenant must identify the \nminimum and maximum floor area designated for each lot, parcel and tract.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.532 \n1/1/25 Hayden Island Plan District \n \n532-5 \n33. 532.230 Transition Between Zones \nA. Purpose. These regulations limit some of the negative impacts of larger-scale development \nin commercial/mixed use or industrial zones on buildings in adjacent residential zones. \nRequiring development to step down near the residential zones avoids having an abrupt \ntransition between the zones, as does the limitation on large blank walls facing  \nresidential sites. \nB.  Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to sites in \ncommercial/mixed use and industrial zones. \nC.  Maximum building height. \n1.  Sites abutting a residential zone. On the portion of a site within 30 feet of a residential \nzone, the maximum building height is 25 feet. See Figure 532-1. \n2. Sites across a street from a residential zone. On the portion of a site within 15 feet of \nthe lot line across the street from a residential zone, the maximum building height is \n25 feet. See Figure 532-2. \nFigure 532-1 \nHeight limits on sites abutting R zones \n \nFigure 532-2 \nHeight limits on sites across a street from R zones \nD.  Required windows above the ground floor. \n1.  Sites abutting a residential zone. On the portion of a site within 30 feet of a residential \nzone, at least 15 percent of the area of the façade above the ground level must be \nwindows. This requirement is in addition to any required ground floor windows.  Chapter 33.532 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHayden Island Plan District 1/1/25 \n \n532-6 \n2.  Sites across a street from a residential zone. On the portion of a site within 15 feet of \nthe lot line across the street from a residential zone, at least 15 percent of the area of \nthe façade above the ground level must be windows. This requirement is in addition \nto any required ground floor windows. \n33.532.240 Transfer of Residential Density \nA.  Purpose. Residential density is limited by the Portland International Airport Noise Impact \nOverlay Zone (the “x” overlay zone), which applies to much of the plan district. In some \ninstances, residential development is tied to previous Multnomah County Comprehensive \nPlan designations. Allowing transfers of residential density provides development flexibility \nwhile adhering to the limits of the overlay zone. \nB.  Density transfers. Residential density may be transferred among sites in the plan district if \nall of the following are met: \n1.  The receiving sites must be located within the same or lesser noise contour of the x \noverlay as the sending sites; \n2.  The receiving site must be in a C or R zone; \n3. The maximum density allowed on the receiving site, including transferred density, is 1 \ndwelling unit per 700 square feet of site area; and \n4.  The property owners of both sending and receiving sites must execute a covenant \nwith the City that is attached to and recorded with the deeds of both the sending and \nreceiving sites reflecting the respective increase and decrease of potential density. \nThe covenant must meet the requirements of Section 33.700.060. \n33.532.245 Maximum Setbacks in Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \nThe maximum setbacks that apply to sites in commercial/mixed use zones in Pedestrian Districts \napply to all sites in commercial/mixed use zones in the plan district. \n33.532.250 Main Entrance \nA.  Purpose. Locating the main entrance of a use near the street provides convenient \npedestrian access between the use and public sidewalks and transit facilities, and so \npromotes walking and the use of transit. \nB.  Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to sites in \ncommercial/mixed use zones. If a site has frontage on more than one street, and one of the \nstreets is an Island Core Access Street, the main entrance must face the Core Street. If the \nsite has frontage on two Core Access Streets, or on two non-Core Access Streets, this \nstandard must be met on only one of the frontages. Island Main Core Access Streets are \nshown on Map 532-3. \nC.  Location. For each building, at least one main entrance must: \n1.  Be within 25 feet of a street; \n2.  Allow pedestrians to both enter and exit the building; and \n3.  Either:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.532 \n1/1/25 Hayden Island Plan District \n \n532-7 \na.  Face the street; or \nb.  Be at an angle of up to 45 degrees from the street, measured from the street \nproperty line, as shown in Figure 532-3, below. \nD.  Unlocked during regular business hours. The main entrance that meets the standards of \nSubsection C, above, must be unlocked during regular business hours. \nFigure 532-3  \nMain Entrance \n \n33.532.255 Buildings Fronting on Internal Accessways \nA.  Purpose. Internal accessways allow an alternative for larger retail buildings on very large \nsites to provide functional pedestrian connections, building locations, and main entrance \nplacement without meeting the standards of the base zone. These larger retail buildings \ncan still meet the intent of the base zone regulations and be transit-supportive and \npedestrian-friendly by requiring the building to meet standards associated with transit \nstreets on the internal accessway. These accessways provide a finer network of street and \npedestrian connectivity linking development to public streets. \nB.  Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to buildings in the \nJantzen Beach subdistrict where a single use occupies over 60,000 square feet of floor area \nin a single story. \nC.  Building regulations. Buildings which front on an internal accessway are exempt from the \nmaximum building setback, ground floor windows and transit street main entrance \nstandards of the base zone and the Hayden Island plan district if the buildings meet the \nbase zone standard for maximum building setback, ground floor windows and transit street  Chapter 33.532 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHayden Island Plan District 1/1/25 \n \n532-8 \nmain entrance along an internal accessway. The internal accessway must meet the \nrequirements for Subsection D. \nD.  Internal accessways. The internal accessway must meet the following: \n1.  The internal accessway must have at least one auto travel lane, curbs, and an \nunobstructed sidewalk which separates the building from the curb. \n2.  The drive aisle may be up to 25 feet wide, and must provide a direct connection to an \nIsland commercial core street or to a Transit Station. \n3.  One of the following must be met, as shown in Figure 532-4: \na.  The sidewalk must be at least 15 feet wide and planted with trees a maximum of \n30 feet on center. Trees must be planted in the center of unpaved tree wells at \nleast 18 square feet, with a minimum dimension of 3 feet. The unpaved area may \nbe covered with a tree grate. Tree wells must be adjacent to the curb, and must \nbe located so there is at least 6 feet of unobstructed sidewalk; or \nb.  The sidewalk must be at least 10 feet wide. There must be a planting strip at \nleast 5 feet wide. The planting strip must be between the curb and the sidewalk, \nand be landscaped to at least the L1 standard, except that trees cannot  \nbe grouped. \n4.  Parallel parking is allowed between the sidewalk and the drive aisle provided if it is at \nleast 50 feet from the main entrance. Parallel parking may reduce the width of the \nsidewalk to 10 feet with trees a maximum of 30 feet on center or 6 feet with a 4-foot \nwide planting strip. \n33.532.260 Street Connectivity \nA.  Purpose. The connectivity requirement ensures that adequate street and \npedestrian/bicycle connections will be provided for local access to development and access \nfor emergency vehicles. This regulation implements the Hayden Island Master Street Plan \nand improves vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle movement throughout the plan district, \nwhile reducing congestion. Where full street connections are not feasible, pedestrian and \nbicycle connections provide access for those users most sensitive to the lack of direct \nconnections. \nB.  Requirements. \n1.  The Portland Bureau of Transportation determines the location and widths of rights-\nof-way and extent and timing of street improvements based on the Hayden Island \nMaster Street Plan in the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan. \n2.  New street alignments as identified in the Hayden Island Master Street Plan are \nregulated by Chapter 17.88.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.532 \n1/1/25 Hayden Island Plan District \n \n532-9 \nFigure 532-4 \nBuildings On Internal Accessways \n  Chapter 33.532 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHayden Island Plan District 1/1/25 \n \n532-10 \n33.532.270 Drive-Through Facilities \nA.  Purpose. \n1.  In the area west of Center Avenue which is designated as a pedestrian district, these \nregulations discourage development that adversely affects the pedestrian \nenvironment, and limits auto-oriented uses. \n2.  The area east of Center Avenue is not designated as a pedestrian district and is \nappropriate for auto-oriented uses, based on the current uses and the proximity to \nthe bridge; these uses serve both those in autos and those on foot. These regulations \npreserve the ability of existing and future businesses to have drive-through facilities. \nB.  Regulation. \n1.  West of Center Avenue, drive-through facilities are prohibited on the portion of a site \nwithin a pedestrian district. This prohibition includes curb cuts and driveways used for \naccess to the drive-through facility, stacking lanes for queuing vehicles, and the facility \nitself, such as the drive-up window or gas pump island. \n2.  East of Center Avenue, drive-through facilities are allowed on the portion of a site \nwithin a CM1 zone. Access must be from N. Jantzen Drive, but location is not \notherwise limited to particular streets. \n \n(Added by Ord. No. 183124, effective 9/18/09. Amended by: Ord.

Healy Heights has a concentrated and \ncomplex array of radiofrequency sources and towers located within a developed single-family \nneighborhood. The plan district protects the established character of the neighborhood while \nensuring that the broadcast and communications industry at this location remains viable. This plan \ndistrict achieves its purpose through: \n• Control of aesthetic impacts through limitations on additions to or expansion of  \nbroadcast towers; \n• Improving the opportunity for communication between the users of broadcast facilities and \nsurrounding residents; \n• Requiring mitigation of the effects of radiofrequency interference to the extent  \npracticable; and \n• Reaffirming the importance of Healy Heights to the Radio Frequency Transmission industry \nand to the people served by that industry. \n33.533.020 Where the Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply only to Radio Frequency Transmission Facilities within the Healy \nHeights Plan District. All Radio Frequency Transmission Facilities and accessory uses are described in and \nregulated by Chapter 33.274. The boundaries of the plan district are shown on Map 533-1 at the end of \nthis chapter, and on the Official Zoning Maps. \n33.533.030 Existing Towers \nExisting towers may continue to operate. Up to 7 Radio Frequency Transmission towers are allowed \nin the plan district. Additional towers are prohibited. When a tower is removed from the plan \ndistrict, the maximum number of towers allowed is reduced accordingly. The maximum number of \ntowers cannot exceed the number of towers present in the plan district.  Chapter 33.533 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHealy Heights Plan District 7/11/14 \n \n533-2 \n \n33.533.040 Relocation of Existing Towers \nExisting towers may be relocated within the plan district if the review body finds the following \napproval criteria are met: \nA. Relocation of an existing tower does not result in a taller tower, an increase in the extent \nto which ice may fall from the tower to a nearby property in residential use, an increase in \nwind noise, or in power density on properties in residential use. \nB. Relocation of an existing tower must result in reduced aesthetic impact for nearby \nresidential uses and may not result in a significant increase in the aesthetic impacts to the \nCity as whole. Aesthetic impacts include, but are not limited to: \n• Tower design; \n• Tower height; \n• Tower mass; \n• Tower coloring/visibility; \n• Landscaping; \n• Accessory structure design; and \n• Setbacks. \n33.533.050 New Towers and Expanded Facilities \nNew towers and reconstruction that will expand tower capacity may be approved if the review body \nfinds the approval criteria of A and B, below, are met. Temporary towers may be approved if the \nreview body finds that criterion C, below, is met. All other new towers or reconstruction that will \nexpand tower capacity are prohibited. \nA. Tower sharing. The new or expanded tower facility is designed as a shared use facility and \nwill provide for consolidation of existing Radio Frequency Transmission Facilities from \nwithin the plan district. \nB. Tower consolidation. An existing tower, or towers, within the plan district is to be \nremoved as part of the proposal, resulting in a net reduction of the number of towers \npresent in the plan district. \nC. Temporary towers. Temporary auxiliary towers may be used when necessary for the \nreconstruction of an existing tower, to protect workers from excessive levels of \nradiofrequency energy, or to replace a damaged tower. The temporary auxiliary tower may \nremain until such time as the existing tower is returned to regular use, and then it must be \ndismantled and removed from the plan district within 90 days. A temporary tower may not \nbe in place for more than 2 years or exceed the radio frequency emissions levels or \nexposure limits established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Applicants \nmust certify compliance with FCC emissions standards with the permit application. \n33.533.060 Damage, Destruction, and Discontinuance \nA. Reconstruction and maintenance. Existing towers may be repaired or undergo major \nmaintenance for structural safety, as confirmed by a licensed engineer. Repair or \nmaintenance may not result in a tower with increased dimensions. Improved structural  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.533 \n7/11/14 Healy Heights Plan District \n \n533-3 \nintegrity may not, by itself, result in an increase in the number of antennas or transmitters, \nor in power density. \nB. Discontinuance. In the event that a tower is demolished or not used and maintained as a \nbroadcast or relay facility for a period of 2 years, it must be dismantled and removed from \nthe plan district. \n33.533.070 Development Standards \nA. Minimum site size. The minimum site size requirements of 33.274.040, do not apply to \nsites in this plan district, as they appear at the time of adoption of this plan district, and as \nlong as such sites have a tower used and maintained as a broadcast or relay facility. \nB. Setbacks. Where the subject site abuts a site which includes a Radio Frequency \nTransmission Facility, the minimum tower setback requirements of 33.274.040, do not \napply to new or replacement towers in this plan district. Where the subject site abuts a site \nin exclusive residential use, the minimum tower setback requirements of 33.274.040 apply \nto all new or replacement towers in this plan district. \nC. Other development aspects. All aspects of development not regulated by this chapter are \nregulated by 33.274. \n33.533.080 Monitoring and Power Density Measurements \nA. Monitoring. Monitoring of RF fields will occur as determined by the Healy Heights RF \nAdvisory Board, to confirm that conditions as described by An Investigation of \nRadiofrequency Fields on Healy Heights, Portland, Oregon, Phase II, December 16, 1991, \nhave remained the same or changed in the manner predicted by subsequent approved \napplications for change or addition. \n1. Monitoring must be performed by a qualified technician or engineer. \n2. Monitoring will consist of measurement of radiofrequency fields in a manner \ncomparative to and compatible with, the methodology used in and described by An \nInvestigation of Radiofrequency Fields on Healy Heights, Portland, Oregon, Phase I, \nAugust 14, 1990. \n3. Monitoring must include at least the points used for narrow band measurements in \nAn Investigation of Radiofrequency Fields on Healy Heights, Portland, Oregon, Phases \nI and II, plus a minimum of 10 other points identified in that document, falling outside \nof and generally dispersed around the plan district. \n4. Monitoring will occur when there is reasonable cause to believe that one or more of \nthe facilities at Healy Heights is causing radiofrequency radiation in excess of the \nlevels allowed. Monitoring may occur at random. \nB. Required power density assessment. \n1. Calculation of power density. All applications for new or expanded facilities not \nexempted by 33.274.030, will be accompanied by a calculation of the effects of the \nproposed facility on the existing radiofrequency environment. The calculation of \npower density must be made for the points used for narrow band measurements in  Chapter 33.533 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHealy Heights Plan District 7/11/14 \n \n533-4 \n \nAn Investigation of Radiofrequency Fields on Healy Heights, Portland, Oregon, Phases \nI and II, plus a minimum of 10 other points identified in this document, falling outside \nof and generally dispersed around the plan district. \n2. Measurement of power density. When calculations show that the majority of the \nmeasurement points will have an increase of 25 percent of the difference between \nthe latest base line study of power density levels and the maximum power density \nallowed, a new base line power density level must be established. A new base line will \nbe established by measuring the power density at, or as near as reasonably possible, \nall measurement points identified in An Investigation of Radiofrequency Fields on \nHealy Heights, Portland, Oregon, Phases I and II, after regular operation of the facility \nhas commenced. Final approval of the facility will be contingent upon documenting \ncompliance with the radio frequency emissions levels and exposure limits established \nby the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). \nC. Method of power density measurements. All measurements, whether for monitoring or \nrequired of an applicant, must be made in the manner described by the section entitled \nTechnical Approach, beginning on page 9 of An Investigation of Radiofrequency Fields on \nHealy Heights, Portland, Oregon, Phase I, August 14, 1990. For the purpose of monitoring \nradiofrequency fields, measurements need not necessarily occur at all points measured in \nAn Investigation of Radiofrequency Fields on Healy Heights, Portland, Oregon, Phases I and \nII, but should occur as near to those points as reasonably possible and in sufficient number \nto ascertain to what extent the radiofrequency environment has changed. \n33.533.090 Radiofrequency Interference \nAll Radio Frequency Transmission Facilities owners and operators are responsible for assuring that \ninterference to consumer electronic devices, from their equipment, is kept to the minimum  \nlevel possible. \nA. Interference survey. Surveying the extent of radiofrequency interference (RFI) will occur in \nthe manner and frequency as determined by the Healy Heights RF Advisory Board. Survey \nof RFI may be included as a condition of approval to a land use approval or as a joint \nresponsibility of the operators and owners of the Healy Heights RF facilities. To the extent \npossible, such surveys will determine the types of interference encountered, the area of \ninterference, and the source of interference. \nB. Mitigation of interference. When the source of RFI can be determined, the owner and \noperator of that source will be responsible for any and all steps necessary for mitigation of \nthe effects of the RFI, as determined appropriate by the Healy Heights RF Advisory Board. \n33.533.100 Procedures \nConstruction of a temporary tower will be reviewed through the Type II procedure. All other Radio \nFrequency Transmission Facility proposals are subject to the review procedures of Chapter 33.274, \nRadio Frequency Transmission Facilities. \nThe staff may require an application for a new tower to be reviewed by the Design Commission for \nadvice to the Hearings Officer or City Council. \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.533 \n7/11/14 Healy Heights Plan District \n \n533-5 \n(Added by: Ord.

Specific objectives of the plan district include \nstrengthening Hollywood’s role as a commercial and residential center, and promoting the use of \nlight rail, bus transit, and walking. These regulations: \n• Enhance business and economic vitality; \n• Promote housing and mixed-use development; \n• Discourage auto-oriented uses and developments and direct the placement of auto-oriented \nuses and developments away from the area of most intense activity; \n• Reinforce the connection between the Hollywood Transit Center and the business core of \nthe Hollywood District; \n \n• Enhance the pedestrian experience; and  Chapter 33.536 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHollywood Plan District  6/1/25 \n536-2 \n• Enhance the character of buildings in the plan district. \n33.536.020 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this Chapter apply in the Hollywood plan district. The boundaries of the plan \ndistrict and subdistricts are shown on Map 536-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the Official \nZoning Maps. \nUse Regulations \n33.536.100 Purpose \nUse restrictions in the area near the transit center and in the business core of Hollywood ensure \nthat development maximizes the public's investment in transit. The restrictions also strengthen the \nrole of Hollywood as a mixed-use center. Limits on parking and auto-oriented uses encourage \npedestrian and transit-oriented uses and activities. Requiring residential uses in key areas supports \nthe commercial uses in Hollywood and also increases pedestrian activity near the transit center and \nin the commercial core of Hollywood.  \n33.536.110 Additional Prohibited Uses \nA. Purpose. These regulations limit auto-oriented uses in the plan district, and help reduce \ntraffic congestion, especially in the commercial core of Hollywood. \nB. Additional prohibited uses.  \n1. Park and Ride facilities are prohibited in the plan district; and \n2. Vehicle Repair and Quick Vehicle Servicing are prohibited in Subdistrict A. \n33.536.120 Required Residential Uses \nA. Purpose. This regulation ensures a minimum level of housing in the area near the \nHollywood Transit Center to support transit use and promote a dense, vital, urban-scaled \nmix of uses and activities. Housing is particularly important in this mix because it supports \nthe commercial uses, promotes walking from residential areas to nearby services, and \ncontributes to evening and weekend activity. \nB. Where this regulation applies. The regulation of this section applies to new development \nor additions of more than 2,500 square feet of floor area in the Required Residential Area \nshown on Map 536-1.  \nC. Required residential uses. At least 50 percent of new floor area must be in  \nresidential uses. \n33.536.130 Commercial Parking in the CM2 and CM3 Zones \nA. Purpose. These regulations allow Commercial Parking that serves employees and visitors in \nHollywood while discouraging parking for those who park in Hollywood and take transit to \nother destinations. \nB. Limitations on Commercial Parking uses. Commercial Parking in the CM2 and CM3 zones is \na conditional use, and must be in a structure.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.536 \n6/1/25 Hollywood Plan District \n \n536-3 \nC. Supplemental application requirements. A parking demand analysis is required to show a \nneed for Commercial Parking at this location. \nDevelopment Standards \n33.536.200 Purpose \nThese development standards foster a mixed-use urban character with a high quality pedestrian \nenvironment, and an emphasis on good building design. The standards also promote the Enhanced \nPedestrian Streets as the primary pedestrian routes in the plan district. Finally, these standards help \nensure an attractive transition in areas where commercial and residential zones abut. \n33.536.210 Prohibited Development  \nA. Purpose. These regulations limit auto-oriented development and ensure transit-supportive \nlevels of residential development in the commercial core of the plan district and in the \nareas closest to the Hollywood Transit Center. The regulations also support existing \nbusinesses with drive-through facilities by creating limited opportunity for these facilities \nto redevelop as part of development that fosters an urban mix and intensity of uses. \nB. Single-dwelling residential. Single-Dwelling residential development is prohibited in \nSubdistrict A. Alterations to existing Single-Dwelling residential development are allowed. \nC. Accessory parking. Parking that is accessory to uses outside of the plan district  \nis prohibited. \nD. Drive-through facilities. Drive-through facilities are prohibited, except that in Subdistrict B, \ndrive-through facilities may be allowed if they meet all of the regulations of  \nthis subsection: \n1. There was a legal drive-through facility on the site on May 5, 2000; \n2. The new drive-through is on the same site and the existing drive-through will  \nbe removed; \n3. The replaced drive-through facility will be part of a new development on the site that \nmeets the following: \na. After the new development is built, the FAR on the site must be at least  \n1.5:1; and \nb. At least 25 percent of the new floor area must be in residential uses; \n4. The drive-through facility must either: \na. Meet the standards of Chapter 33.224, Drive-Through Facilities; or \nb. Meet the following: \n(1) The service area must be within the primary structure on the site; \n(2) The service area must have useable floor area above it on the second  \nstory; and  Chapter 33.536 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHollywood Plan District  6/1/25 \n536-4 \n(3) The stacking lanes must meet the standards of Section 33.224.050, Stacking \nLane Standards, and must be enclosed within the primary structure on the \nsite; and \n5. Access to and from NE Sandy Blvd. for the drive-through is prohibited. \n33.536.220 Maximum Building Height \nThe maximum building heights are shown on Map 536-2 except as specified in Subsection \n33.536.230.C. Except as follows, adjustments to these heights shown on Map 536-2 are prohibited. \nUntil January 2, 2032, adjustments to increase maximum building height may be requested for new \nbuildings when at least 75 percent of the total floor area is in a residential use. In this case, \nadjustments to increase maximum building heights by more than 20 percent of the height limit \nshown on Map 536-2, or 10 feet, whichever is greater, are prohibited. \n33.536.230 Transition Between Residential and Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \nA. Purpose. These regulations ensure that there is a transition in height when \ncommercial/mixed use sites are abutting or across the street from low and medium density \nresidential zones. In addition, the regulations prevent large blank walls above the ground \nfloor from facing residential sites from across a street and ensure that building heights \nreduce to relate to adjoining single-dwelling zones. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to sites in  \ncommercial zones. \nC. Maximum building height. \n1. Generally. The maximum allowed building height is shown on Map 536-2, Building \nHeights, except as specified in Paragraphs C.2 and C.3 below: \n2. Sites abutting RF – RM2 zones. Sites abutting RF through RM2 zones have height limits \nthat decrease in two steps near the residential zone. See Figure 536-1. These height \nlimits are: \na. On the portion of a site within 25 feet of a site zoned RF through RM2, the \nmaximum building height is the same as the abutting residential zone. \nb. On the portion of a site that is more than 25 feet but within 50 feet of a site \nzoned RF through RM2, the maximum building height is 45 feet. \n3. Sites across a street from RF – RM2 zones. Sites across a street from RF through RM2 \nzones have height limits that decrease near the residential zone. On the portion of the \nsite within 15 feet of the lot line across the street from a site zoned RF though RM2, \nthe maximum building height is the same as the residential zone across the street.

In a series of stepped facades at an angle to Sandy Boulevard in which all outside \nbuilding corners are at the same distance from Sandy Boulevard, as shown in  \nFigure 536-4. \nFigure 536-4 \nExamples of building facades facing Sandy Boulevard \n \n33.536.280 Enhanced Pedestrian Street Standards \nA. Purpose. These regulations enhance and ensure the continuity of the pedestrian \nenvironment and emphasize a core of business activities in Hollywood along the Enhanced \nPedestrian Streets. The standards also help maintain a thriving urban district along the  Chapter 33.536 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHollywood Plan District  6/1/25 \n536-12 \nEnhanced Pedestrian Streets through the interrelationships of active uses on the ground \nfloor of buildings and the street level pedestrian environment.  \nB. Where these regulations apply. These regulations apply to new development on sites with \nfrontage on the Enhanced Pedestrian Streets shown on Map 536-3. Alterations or exterior \nimprovements to existing development are exempt from these regulations. Development \nthat includes a residential use is exempt from the enhanced pedestrian street standards \nuntil January 1, 2029. \nC. Enhanced Pedestrian Street standards. New development must meet the  \nfollowing standards: \n1. Active building uses. Buildings must be designed and constructed to accommodate \nactive uses, such as lobbies, residential, retail, commercial, or office. This standard \nmust be met along at least 50 percent of the ground floor of walls that are at an angle \nof 45 degrees or less from the street lot line of an Enhanced Pedestrian Street. \nAccessory structures are exempt from this standard. \n Areas designed to accommodate active building uses must meet all of the  \nfollowing standards: \na. The distance from the finished floor to the bottom of the structure above must \nbe at least 12 feet. The bottom of the structure above includes  \nsupporting beams; \nb. The area must be at least 25 feet deep, measured from the street-facing facade;  \nc. The area must be designed to accommodate a single tenant or multiple tenants; \nd.

Purpose. Limiting the number of parking spaces allowed promotes efficient use of land, \nenhances urban form, encourages use of alternative modes of transportation, provides for \na better pedestrian environment, and protects air and water quality. Parking that is \nprovided in structures is preferred over parking in surface lots because, as an even more \nefficient use of land, structured parking promotes compact urban development. In \naddition, parking structures with active uses on the ground floor provide a better \nenvironment for pedestrians, and contribute to the continuity of street-level retail and \nservice uses that support a thriving urban area.  \n \nThe maximum ratios are lower in Hollywood than in many other parts of the city because \nthe entire plan district is within one-half mile of a light rail station and the Hollywood \nTransit Center.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.536 \n6/1/25 Hollywood Plan District \n \n536-13 \nB. Where these regulations apply.

Surface and structured accessory parking is limited to the maximum ratios \nlisted as Standard A in Table 266-2, except as allowed in Paragraphs C.2 through C.4, \nbelow. When there is more than one primary use on a site, the amount of parking \nallowed is calculated based on the net building area of each use, or for household \nliving, based on the number of units. \n2.  Household Living. For Household Living uses, the maximum ratio for surface parking is \n1.35 spaces per unit. When 75 percent or more of the parking is in structured parking \nthe maximum number of parking spaces allowed is 1.7 spaces per unit. \n3.  Retail Sales And Service. The following maximum ratios apply to the following specific \nRetail Sales And Service uses. The maximum for all other Retail Sales and Service uses \nis stated in Table 266-2: \na.  Retail, personal service, repair oriented. The maximum ratio is 1 space per 250 \nsquare feet of net building area. \nb.  Restaurants and bars. The maximum ratio is 1 per 75 square feet of net building \narea. \n4. Office uses.  \na. Medical and dental clinics. The maximum parking ratio for medical and dental \nclinics is 1 space per 330 square feet of net building area.  \nb. All other Office uses. The maximum parking ratio for all other Office uses is 1 \nspace per 400 square feet of net building area. However, the maximum ratio is 1 \nspace per 300 square feet of net building area if the following are met: \n(1) At least half of the parking accessory to uses on the site is in structured \nparking; \n(2)  Parking structures on the site must be designed so that at least 50 percent \nof the street-facing facade meets the standards of Paragraph \n33.536.280.C.1, Active building uses. Parking structures are structures \nwhere parking occupies more than 50 percent of the gross building area.  \n33.536.300 On-Site Location of Vehicle Areas Along Sandy Boulevard  \nA. Purpose.

Chapter 33.536 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHollywood Plan District  6/1/25 \n536-14 \n33.536.320 Nonconforming Development \nA. Purpose. These regulations ensure that improvements to nonconforming development will \ncomply with the parking limits established for the Hollywood plan district.  \nB. Sites that are nonconforming in maximum allowed parking spaces. If changes to a use or \nbuilding are made to a site that is nonconforming in the maximum allowed parking spaces, \nexisting parking spaces that are in excess of the maximum may be retained if the following \nconditions are met: \n1. Parking area may not be expanded, but may be reconfigured; and \n2. If the parking area is reconfigured, it must meet the minimum setback and perimeter \nlandscaping requirements and the minimum parking space and aisle dimensions \nstated in Chapter 33.266.  \n \n(Added by Ord.

The access must be by a direct route  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.537 \n3/1/24 Johnson Creek Basin Plan District \n \n537-5 \nthat is not more than one-quarter mile long. A direct route is one that follows \npublic or private streets. A direct route may also include a pedestrian path \ndeveloped as part of the proposal if the City receives an access easement for \npublic use of the pedestrian path.  \nb. Sewer and water. Development sites within the project must be served by City \nsanitary sewer and water lines located in dedicated rights-of-way. \nc. Storm water retention and detention. All storm water originating on the site \nmust be managed to ensure that development on the site does not contribute to \nflooding. Stormwater collection systems must be designed so that the post \ndevelopment stormwater flow rate off the site is no greater than the pre-\ndevelopment flow rate off the site. \n33.537.125 Tree Removal Standards \nA. Purpose. The regulations of this section limit tree removal to protect the scenic and \nrecreational quality of the Springwater Corridor, reduce stormwater runoff, flooding, \nerosion, and landslides and protect water quality and native vegetation. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The standards of this section apply to trees that are 6 or \nmore inches in diameter in the following locations: \n1. Within 20 feet of the Springwater Corridor right-of-way; \n2. On sites where any portion of the site is within the combined flood hazard area; and \n3.

The tree must be removed due to installation, repair, or maintenance of water, sewer, \nor stormwater services. For new installation of services, tree removal allowed under \nthis provision is limited to a single 10 foot wide utility corridor per site;  \n5. The tree is within a proposed roadway or City-required construction easement;  \n6. The tree is at least 6 and up to 12 inches in diameter and does not meet any of the \nother standards of this Subsection, but is replaced with two trees. Replacement \nplantings must meet Section 33.248.030, Plant Materials. Trees removed within 20 \nfeet of the Springwater Corridor must be replaced within the 20 feet of the \nSpringwater Corridor; or  Chapter 33.537 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nJohnson Creek Basin Plan District 3/1/24 \n \n537-6 \n7. Trees that do not qualify for removal under C.1 through 6 may be removed if \napproved through tree review as provided in Chapter 33.853, Tree Review. However, \nwhere the tree removal requires environmental review, only environmental review  \nis required.  \nD. Tree removal without development. When no development is proposed, tree removal \nallowed under the standards of Subsection C.1 through 5, above, is subject to the tree \npermit requirements of Title 11, Trees. \n33.537.130 Springwater Corridor Standards \nA. Purpose. This section ensures protection of the Springwater Corridor as a transportation, \nrecreation and scenic amenity. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The standards of this section apply to sites that abut the \nSpringwater Corridor. These regulations do not apply within a public right-of-way. The \nSpringwater Corridor is shown on the Official Zoning Maps and on Map 537-1 at the end of \nthis chapter. \nC. Standards.  \n1. General standards. \na. Motor vehicle areas. Motor vehicle parking, loading, and maneuvering areas are \nnot allowed within 20 feet of a lot line abutting the Springwater Corridor; \nb. Waste collection and waste storage areas.

Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.537 \n3/1/24 Johnson Creek Basin Plan District \n \n537-7 \n33.537.140 South Subdistrict Development Standards \nA. Purpose. These regulations mitigate the negative impacts that may result from the \ndevelopment of areas where flooding and landslides are common. The impermeable clay \nsoils of the steep-sided Boring Lava hills to the south of the creek contribute to rapid \nstormwater runoff in the winter, and contribute to flooding. Unlike the flatter areas north \nof the creek, in the South subdistrict there are numerous small streams that can quickly \ncarry stormwater runoff to Johnson Creek. The extensive tree canopy on these hillsides \nhelps to slow stormwater runoff. Limitations on development density, tree removal, and \nimpervious surface area reduce stormwater runoff, provide groundwater recharge, reduce \nerosion, protect water quality, and retain native vegetation. These regulations work \ntogether to protect watershed health while allowing the safe and efficient development of \nunconstrained lands. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply in the South \nsubdistrict as shown on Map 537-1. Where any portion of a site is in the combined flood \nhazard area, the entire site is exempt from the standards of this section and is instead \nsubject to the regulations of Section 33.537.150, Floodplain Development Standards. \nC. Tree removal. Tree removal is subject to the standards of 33.537.125. \nD. Impervious surface. No more than 50 percent of any site may be developed in impervious \nsurface. Building eaves are included in the calculation of impervious surface. \nE. Maximum Density for Land Divisions and Planned Developments. The maximum allowed \ndensity of development for Land Divisions and Planned Developments is determined by \ncalculating the number of acres in each land classification and multiplying those figures by \nthe following fractions in Table 537-1, below. \n All land in the South subdistrict is divided into three land classifications, Classes I through \nIII. Class I lands are generally the steepest sites having the greatest amount of natural \nhazards while Class III lands are generally flat without natural hazards. This land \nclassification system is the basis for many of the regulations of this chapter. \n \nTable 537-1 \nLand Class Characteristics and Density Restrictions \nLand Class Characteristics of the  \nLand Class \nMaximum Density \n \nClass I lands \nLocated on slopes with a grade \nof 30 percent or greater. \nOne-fourth the maximum \ndensity allowed in the base zone. \n \nClass II lands \nLocated on slopes with grade of \n20 percent or greater, but less \nthan 30 percent. \nOne-half the maximum density \nallowed in the base zone. \n \nClass III lands \nLocated on slopes with grade of \nless than 20 percent. \nMaximum density allowed in  \nbase zone. \n33.537.150 Floodplain Standards \nA. Purpose. The regulations of this section manage development in the floodplain in order to \nprotect the quality and natural functions of the floodplain and reduce the loss of property \nin areas where flooding is common. Together, these regulations help reduce stormwater  Chapter 33.537 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nJohnson Creek Basin Plan District 3/1/24 \n \n537-8 \nrunoff, provide groundwater recharge, reduce erosion, retain and enhance native \nvegetation, and enhance water quality. \nB. Where these regulations apply. These regulations apply to sites where any portion of the \nsite is in the combined flood hazard area. \nC. Housing Types. In the RM1 and RM2 zones, allowed housing types are limited to residential \nstructures with at least two units in each structure and attached housing. A house is \nallowed on lots of record that cannot accommodate more than one dwelling unit under the \nprovisions of Section 33.120.205, Density. Adjustments to this section are prohibited. \nD. Tree removal. Tree removal is subject to the standards of 33.537.125. \nE. Impervious surface. No more than 50 percent of any site may be developed in impervious \nsurface. Building eaves are included in the calculation of impervious surface. \n33.537.160 Johnson Creek Flood Risk Area \nA. Where the entire site is within the Johnson Creek Flood Risk Area, as shown on Map 537-1, \nland divisions and PDs are prohibited. \nB. Where a portion of the site is within the Johnson Creek Flood Risk Area, as shown on Map \n537-1, land divisions and PDs are allowed only if the portion of the site in the Flood Risk \nArea is placed in a tract. \n \n(Added by Ord.

Purpose. The floor area ratios (FARs) regulate the amount, or intensity, of use allowed in \neach subdistrict. The FARs provide a means to match the potential amount of uses with the \ndesired character of the area. FARs also work with the height and building coverage \nstandards to control the overall bulk of development. \nB. Calculations. In Subdistricts A, B, C, and D, FAR is calculated as the amount of floor area in \nrelation to the amount of area in each subdistrict, expressed in square feet. \nC. Standards. The maximum FAR allowed in Subdistricts A, B, and D is 3:1. The maximum FAR \nallowed in Subdistrict C is 2:1. Adjustments to these maximums are prohibited. \n33.555.250 Maximum Building Coverage \nA. Purpose. The building coverage standards work with the FAR and height standards to \ncontrol the overall scale of development and promote development consistent with the \ndesired character of the plan district. The standards also limit the total area of each \nsubdistrict that will be developed with buildings to limit the amount of impervious surfaces \ncreated by buildings. \nB. Calculations.

Within Subdistrict F, building coverage is calculated in \nrelation to the amount of site area. \nC. Standards.  \n1. Subdistrict E. The maximum building coverage allowed in the EX zone in Subdistricts E \nis 15 percent.  \n2. Subdistricts A through D. In Subdistricts A, B, C, and D, there is no limitation on \nbuilding coverage in each subdistrict; however, the maximum building coverage \nallowed in the four subdistricts together is 65 percent. Adjustments to this standard \nare prohibited. \n33.555.260 Formal Open Areas in Subdistricts A through D.  \nA. Purpose. The requirements of this section ensure that the institutionally-developed \nportions of the plan district contain an adequate amount of formal open area, such as \nplazas, courtyards, and similar features, that enhance the character of the area; provide \nopportunities for passive recreation and both formal and informal gatherings; and result in \na network of attractive and integrated exterior spaces and pedestrian corridors that link \nbuildings and various activities within the plan district.  \n These formal open areas are medium to large spaces that are open to the public and are \ntypically located along primary pedestrian routes. Small gardens and courtyards that are \nnot generally accessible to the public and are developed primarily to serve as retreats for  Chapter 33.555 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMarquam Hill Plan District 3/1/20 \n \n555-6 \npatients and their visitors, such as healing gardens or play areas for young patients or their \nvisitors, are not formal open space areas. \nB. When formal open area is required. In Subdistricts A, B, C, and D, when more than 10,000 \nsquare feet of gross floor area is proposed in a subdistrict, formal open area must be \ndeveloped within that subdistrict as part of the proposal, until the minimum square \nfootage of formal open area required in the subdistrict is met. Existing plazas and other \nopen areas may be used to meet this requirement, but will be reviewed as if they are being \ncreated as part of the project. Additional improvements may be required.  \nC. Minimum square footage required. The minimum square footage of formal open area \nrequired in Subdistrict A is 20,000 square feet. The minimum square footage of formal \nopen area required in Subdistricts B and D is 25,000 square feet in each subdistrict. The \nminimum square footage of formal open area required in Subdistrict C is 40,000  \nsquare feet. \nD. Standards. Formal open area used to meet the requirement of Subsection B must meet the \nfollowing standards: \n1. Amount of area required. At least one square foot of formal open area must be \ndeveloped for each 50 square feet of floor area, up to the minimum required square \nfootage of formal open area for the subdistrict;  \n2. Minimum size. Each formal open area must be at least 2,000 square feet in area, and \nbe of such shape to allow a square 40 feet on a side to fit entirely in the area. \n3. Use of area.

These standards: \n• Implement urban design concepts of the North Interstate Corridor Plan; \n• Help ease transitions between new high-density development and the existing, low-density \nneighborhoods; and \n• Enhance the pedestrian experience. \n33.561.020 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply in the North Interstate plan district. The boundaries of the plan \ndistrict are shown on Map 561-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the Official Zoning Maps. \nDevelopment Standards \n33.561.210 Maximum Building Height \nA. Purpose. The maximum building height standards: \n• Allow taller buildings to provide visual prominence and intense activity near station \nplatforms and at identified focal points; \n• Allow taller buildings along Interstate 5 to achieve a defined edge within the larger \nneighborhood context and allow buildings to take greater advantage of views to the \neast over the freeway; and  Chapter 33.561 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nNorth Interstate Plan District 3/1/25 \n561-2 \n \n• Increase opportunities for creative design, encourage quality construction, and foster \nprovision of neighborhood amenities such as underground parking and ground level \nopen space by allowing additional height in special areas with additional  \ndesign requirements. \nB. Maximum building heights. \n1. Generally. The maximum building heights are shown on Map 561-2, except as \nspecified in Section 33.561.230. Except as follows, adjustments to maximum heights \nare prohibited, but modifications through Design Review may be requested. Until \nJanuary 2, 2032, adjustments to increase maximum building height may be requested \nfor new buildings when at least 75 percent of the total floor area is in a residential \nuse. In this case, adjustments to increase the maximum height allowance by more \nthan 20 percent of the height limit shown on Map 561-2, or 10 feet, whichever is \ngreater, are prohibited.   \n2. In the height opportunity areas shown on Map 561-2, buildings may be up to 125 feet \nhigh if: \na. The applicant meets with the Design Commission to discuss the proposal before \napplying for Design Review. As specified in 33.730.050.B, the applicant must \nsubmit a design advice request to schedule this meeting; and \nb. The applicant requests design review, rather than using the Design overlay zone \ndesign standards in 33.420.050. \n33.561.220 Floor Area Ratios \nA. Purpose. The floor area ratio standards work with the maximum building height  \nstandards to: \n• Increase intensity near the light rail stations at the most intensive station areas: \nLombard, Killingsworth, and Prescott; and \n• Allow design flexibility for taller buildings that create opportunities for increased open \nspace on the site and visually prominent architecture. \nB. Where these regulations apply. These regulations apply to new development and \nadditions of floor area to the site. \nC. Regulation. Maximum floor area ratios are shown on Map 561-3. \nD. FAR bonus. The following FAR bonus options apply to sites shown on Map 561-3 as having \na maximum FAR of 4 to 1. The regulations of this Subsection do not apply where Map 561-3 \nindicates that maximum FAR for the site is the base zone maximum; on those sites, the \nbase zone bonus regulations apply. Adjustments to this Subsection, or to the amount of \nmaximum floor area allowed through the bonuses in this Subsection, are prohibited: \n1. Maximum increase in FAR. An increase in FAR through the use of bonuses of more \nthan 1 to 1 is prohibited.  \n2. FAR bonus options:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.561 \n3/1/25 North Interstate Plan District \n \n561-3 \na. Mandatory inclusionary housing bonus option. Bonus FAR is allowed for \ndevelopment that triggers 33.245, Inclusionary Housing. The amount of bonus \nfloor area earned is an amount equal to the net building area of the building that \ntriggers 33.245. To qualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a letter \nfrom the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the regulations of 33.245 have \nbeen met.  \nb. Voluntary inclusionary housing. Bonus FAR is allowed when one of the following \nvoluntary bonus options is met: \n(1) Bonus FAR is allowed for projects that voluntarily comply with the standards \nof 33.245.040 and 33.245.050. The amount of bonus floor area allowed is an \namount equal to the net building area of the building that complies with \n33.245.040 and .050. To qualify for this bonus, the applicant must provide a \nletter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the regulations of \n33.245 have been met. The letter is required to be submitted before a \nbuilding permit can be issued for development, but is not required in order \nto apply for a land use review; or \n(2) Bonus FAR is allowed in exchange for payment into the Affordable Housing \nFund. For each square foot purchased a fee must be paid to the Portland \nHousing Bureau (PHB). The Portland Housing Bureau collects and \nadministers the Affordable Housing Fund, and PHB determines the fee per \nsquare foot and updates the fee at least every three years. The fee schedule \nis available from Portland Permitting & Development. To qualify for this \nbonus option, the applicant must provide a letter from the PHB \ndocumenting the amount that has been contributed to the AHF. The letter is \nrequired to be submitted before a building permit can be issued for the \ndevelopment, but it is not required in order to apply for a land use review. \n33.561.230 Transition Between Zones \nA. Purpose. These regulations ensure that there is a transition in height when high intensity \nzones abut or are across the street from low and medium density residential zones. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to sites in RM3, RM4, \nCX, and CI2 zones that abut or are across a street from an RF through RM2 zone. \nC.

Purpose. The Northwest Master Plan allows flexibility in design and development of a site \nin a manner that evokes an urban development pattern, and does not overwhelm  \npublic services. \nThe provisions of this section accommodate the needs of property owners to begin long-\nrange planning for their property in advance of adoption of the Northwest District Plan. \nThe Northwest District Plan may modify or delete this section of the code. It is likely that \nthere will be significant overlap in both timelines and issues addressed by the private and \npublic planning efforts; the two efforts should inform and improve each other throughout \ntheir processes. \nA Northwest Master Plan will ensure: \n• Pedestrian-oriented, transit-supportive development; \n• Development that includes a variety of uses, but retains the EX zone focus on \nemployment uses that need a central location; \n• High quality design appropriate to an urban setting; \n• Active uses on the ground floor of buildings along designated transit streets and \npedestrian routes; \n• A street pattern that provides for frequent, convenient pedestrian and vehicle \nconnections and emulates levels of connectivity similar to the adjacent block pattern; \n• Transportation and parking demand management strategies that decrease reliance on \nthe automobile;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.562 \n6/1/25 Northwest Plan District \n \n562-13 \n• Development that is integrated into the broader urban fabric; \n• Transitions to adjacent areas with different uses and intensities through use, height, \nand massing of new development, considering historic resources, and the character of \nthe area anticipated through the Northwest District Plan process; and \n• Consideration of opportunities to provide a park, plaza, or other open space that can \nbe used by those working and living in the neighborhood; and efficient use of land. \nB. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to sites shown on \nMap 562-9 at the end of this chapter. The regulations may also apply to areas that are not \nshown on the map, but are contiguous to or across a right-of-way from that area and under \nthe same ownership, if the applicant voluntarily includes them in the Northwest Master \nPlan boundaries.  \nC. When a Northwest Master Plan is required. \n1. Required. A Northwest Master Plan is required for sites shown on Map 562-9 where \nthe applicant proposes: \na. Expansions of floor area or exterior improvements area greater than 1,500 \nsquare feet on the site; or \nb. A change from one use category to another. \n2. Voluntary. An applicant may voluntarily submit a Northwest Master Plan for any site \nnot shown on Map 562-9 if the site is contiguous to or across a right-of-way from the \narea shown on the map and under the same ownership.  \n3. Exempt. The following are allowed without a Northwest Master Plan: \na. Normal maintenance and repair; \nb. Changing up to 5,000 square feet of floor area from an accessory to a primary \nuse, where no change of occupancy is required. An example would be changing \nan employees-only restaurant to a public restaurant; and \nc. Development where all of the floor area and exterior improvement area is in \nresidential use; and \nd. Fences, handicap access ramps, and on-site pedestrian systems.  \nD. Components of a Northwest Master Plan. The applicant must submit a Northwest Master \nPlan with all of the following components: \n1. Boundaries. The boundaries of the area to be included in the Northwest Master Plan. \nThe area must include all contiguous lots within the area shown on Map 562-9 that \nare owned by the same person, partnership, association, or corporation.

The portions of the plan district that include the Balch Creek Watershed and the Forest Park \nSubdistrict contain unique, high quality resources and functional values that require additional \nprotection beyond that of the Environmental overlay zone. The Linnton Hillside subarea within the \nForest Park subdistrict contains a residential area that is constrained by natural conditions and limited \nexisting infrastructure. The development standards for this subarea are intended to protect the public \nhealth and safety by limiting the potential number of new housing units consistent with these \nconstraints. The plan district also promotes the orderly development of the Skyline subdistrict while \nassuring that adequate services are available to support development. These regulations provide the \nhigher level of protection necessary for the plan district area. The transfer of development rights option \nreduces development pressure on protected sites while containing safeguards to protect receiving sites. \n33.563.020 Where the Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to the Northwest Hills plan district and subdistricts as shown on \nMap 563-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the Official Zoning Maps.

Sites in the single-dwelling zones that are entirely within the Environmental \nProtection overlay zone may transfer development rights. \nB. Receiving sites. Sites in the RF zone inside the Urban Growth Boundary may receive \ndevelopment rights from sending sites. Dwelling units resulting from the transfer may not be \nplaced within an environmental zone. \nC. Maximum density. The density of the receiving site may not exceed 0.75 units per acre, except \nthat when the following standards are met, total density may be increased to 1 unit per acre: \n1. For every unit transferred to the receiving site, there is one acre of land with slopes of less \nthan 10 percent; and \n2. Approval for on-site septic disposal has been granted by Portland Permitting & \nDevelopment or sanitary sewer is available to all lots proposed as part of a land division. \nD. Procedure. Transfer of development rights is allowed as follows:  \n1. Planned Development required. The receiving site must be approved for development as a \nPlanned Development. The purpose of the Planned Development Review is to ensure that \nthe extra density is developed appropriately on the receiving site according to the \nrequirements and approval criteria in Chapter 33.638 Planned Development. \n2. Sending site included. The sending site must be a part of the application for Planned \nDevelopment Review on the receiving site. The purpose of this requirement is to allow the \nCity to track the reduced development potential on sending sites. \n3. Covenant required. The owner of the sending site must execute a covenant with the City \nthat reflects the reduced development potential on the sending site. The covenant must \nmeet the requirements of 33.700.060. The covenant must be recorded before approval of \nthe Planned Development or if the Planned Development includes a land division, before \nthe approval of the Final Plat. \nE.

When a flag lot is allowed. Flag lots are prohibited in the Pleasant Valley plan district \nexcept as follows: \n1. A new lot is being created for an existing house;  Chapter 33.564 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nPleasant Valley Plan District 1/1/25 \n564-4 \n \n2. The existing house is entirely within the Pleasant Valley Natural Resources overlay \nzone; and \n3. The existing house will remain. \nC. Flag lot access pole. The pole portion of the flag lot must meet the following standards. \nExcept as allowed in Subparagraph C.1. adjustments are prohibited: \n1. The pole must connect to a street; \n2. The pole must be at least 12 feet wide for its entire length. Until January 2, 2032, \nadjustments to reduce the pole width by up to 10 percent may be requested; and \n3. The pole must be part of the flag lot and must be under the same ownership as the \nflag portion. \nD. Minimum lot dimensions. Flag lots must meet the minimum lot dimension requirements of \nSubparagraph 33.465.165.A.2.c. \n33.564.360 Planned Development \nThe following uses and development are prohibited through a planned development in the RF zone: \nA. Attached houses; \nB. Attached duplexes; \nC. Triplexes; \nD. Fourplexes; \nE. Multi-dwelling structures; and \nF. Commercial uses. \n33.564.370 Housing Variety \nA. Purpose. The purpose of the housing variety criterion is: \n• To encourage the mix of housing intended for the Pleasant Valley plan district as \ndescribed in the Comprehensive Plan \n• To avoid over-repetition of the same building type or lot size \n• To promote housing choice \nB. When this criterion applies. This criterion applies to land divisions and Planned \nDevelopments in the R7 zone. \nC. Approval criterion. To the extent practicable, the design and layout of the land division \nensures that a range of housing choices will be provided within the land division site. Some \nmethods to provide this range of housing choices are: \n1. Thirty percent of the proposed lots are larger than 7,500 square feet in area, and the \nremaining lots are less than 7,500 square feet in area; \n2. Twenty percent of the dwelling units are duplexes, triplexes, or fourplexes;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.564 \n1/1/25 Pleasant Valley Plan District \n \n564-5 \n3. Thirty percent of the lots have accessory dwelling units; or \n4. Other techniques which are consistent with the purpose of this criterion. \n33.564.380 Transition at the Edge of the Pleasant Valley Natural Resources Overlay Zone \nA. Purpose. The purpose of this criterion is to provide a visual and physical transition or \nconnection between the Pleasant Valley Natural Resources overlay zone and the adjoining \ndeveloped land. The criterion is intended to encourage careful design of the land division \nlayout so that uses and development at the edges of the environmental zone have reduced \nimpact on, and benefit from, the adjacent natural resources area. \nB. When this criterion applies. This criterion applies to land divisions and Planned \nDevelopments in the R7 zone. \nC. Approval criterion. To the extent practicable, the land division should be designed so that \ndevelopment adjacent to or across the street from the environmental resource areas is \noriented to enhance the connection between the developed area and the environmental \nresource area. This connection can be provided by one or more of the following: \n1. Local streets are located along the outside edge of the Pleasant Valley Natural \nResources overlay zone; \n2. Where lots are adjacent to the Pleasant Valley Natural Resources overlay zone, \npedestrian access to the Pleasant Valley Natural Resources overlay zone is provided at \nsufficient intervals, such as every 400 to 500 feet; or \n3. Other techniques which are consistent with the purpose of this criterion. \n \n(Added by: Ord. No. 178961, effective 6/13/05. Amended by Ord. No. 184235, effective 11/26/10; \nOrd.

PDX is a unique land use within the City and requires tailored \nregulations to address wildlife hazards and impacts to transportation and natural resources. The  \nplan district provides flexibility to the Port of Portland—owner of PDX—to address a constantly \nchanging aviation industry, while addressing the broader community impacts of operating an airport \nin an urban context.  \nThe regulations of this plan district protect significant identified environmental resources consistent \nwith the requirements of airport operations, while maintaining or enhancing the capacity of public \nand private infrastructure within and serving the district. Additionally, the regulations protect \nsignificant archaeological features of the area. \nThe plan district has two subdistricts: the Airport Subdistrict and the Middle Columbia  \nSlough Subdistrict. \nThe Airport Subdistrict includes the airport passenger terminal, terminal roadway area, airfield, and \nother support facilities most of which are owned and operated by the Port of Portland. Also included \nare other airport-related uses which are generally tenants of the Port. Within the Airport Subdistrict \nare two unmapped areas known as airside and landside (See Chapter 33.910, Definitions). Airside \nincludes an area defined by a perimeter security fence and the airside uses associated with the \nairfield which includes runways, taxiways, lighting, etc. The perimeter security fence is not mapped \nsince the fence may move over time due to federal and operational requirements. An area outside \nthe fence—the runway protection zone—is also part of Airside. The airfield and airside uses are also \ntreated differently due to federal regulations. Landside includes the passenger terminal, airport \naccess roadways, parking lots, aircraft maintenance facilities, cargo hangars, maintenance buildings, \nfire and rescue facilities, and other similar types of development. Also within the Airport Subdistrict \nis the SW Quadrant Subarea, shown on Map 565-1.  \nThe remainder of the plan district is the Middle Columbia Slough Subdistrict. The primary purpose of \nthe regulations for this subdistrict is to promote eco-industrial development on sites that transition \nto industrial use from golf course use.  \n33.565.020 Where These Regulations Apply  \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to the Portland International Airport plan district. The \nboundaries of the plan district and subdistricts are shown on Map 565-1 at the end of this chapter \nand on the Official Zoning Map.  \nThe regulations of Sections 33.565.010 through .030 and .110 apply to the entire plan district. The \nregulations of Sections 33.565.100 and 200 through .240 and 33.565.310 through .320 apply only in \nthe Airport Subdistrict. Section 33.565.250 applies only to the SW Quadrant subarea of the Airport \nSubdistrict. Sections 33.565.400 and .410 apply only in the Middle Columbia Slough Subdistrict. \nSections 33.565.500 through .560 apply in the Environmental Overlay Zones.  \nBecause Federal regulation preempts local rules, development in the Airside portion of the plan \ndistrict — other than new runways — is not subject to the regulations of this chapter.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.565 \n3/1/20 Portland International Airport Plan District \n \n565-3 \n33.565.030 Relationship to Other Regulations and Agencies  \nThis chapter contains only some of the City’s regulations for the plan district. Other chapters of the \nZoning Code may apply in the plan district, including the Noise Impact Overlay Zone, the Aircraft \nLanding Overlay Zone, and the Environmental Overlay Zones. Activities the City regulates through \nthe Zoning Code may also be regulated by other agencies. In particular, because a large area of the \nplan district is owned by the Port of Portland and was originally purchased for aviation use, the \nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) reviews development proposals and amendments to this \nchapter to ensure that there are no adverse impacts on airport operations. While the regulations of \nthis plan district have been designed to minimize any potential conflicts, City approval does not \nimply approval by the FAA or other agencies.\n \nUse Regulations \n33.565.100 Additional Allowed Uses in the Airport Subdistrict \nThe following additional uses are allowed in the Airport Subdistrict: \nA. Aviation and Surface Passenger Terminals are allowed in the IG2 zone; and  \nB. Hotels and motels are allowed in the EG2 and IG2 zones. \nDevelopment Regulations \n33.565.110 Archaeological Resource Protection \nArchaeological evidence has confirmed that American Indians used the plan district area prior to \nentry of EuroAmericans to the Portland area. The Port of Portland continuously updates an \ninventory of cultural resource sites on Port-owned property and is required by Federal regulations \nto address cultural resources in any development project.  \nAlthough the zoning code does not address new discoveries of archaeological resources found \nduring project construction, applicants should be aware of state and federal regulations that apply \nto such discoveries. \nAreas shown on Map 565-2 must meet the requirements of Section 33.515.262 Archeological \nResources Protection. \nRegulations in the Airport Subdistrict \n33.565.200 Supplemental Application Requirement \nApplications for building permits, zoning permits, or land use reviews in the IG2 zone must include \ndocumentation of current activity levels in terms of Million Annual Passengers. This demonstrates \nwhether a Transportation Impact Analysis Review is required. See Section 33.565.240, \nTransportation Impact Analysis Review. \n33.565.210 New Airport Capacity \nA. Purpose. Because the potential impacts of a third parallel runway at the airport are so \nsignificant, this section prohibits additional runways. The effect of the prohibition is that a \nlegislative project to amend this plan district would be necessary to add a third runway. \nThe legislative project would require the City and Port of Portland to engage the regional  Chapter 33.565 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nPortland International Airport Plan District 3/1/20 \n \n565-4 \ncommunity in a cooperative effort to create a development plan for the airport that \naddresses transportation and infrastructure needs, as well as community impacts, by \nexploring alternatives to a potential third runway.  \nB. Regulations: \n1. New runways are prohibited; however, extending, widening, or reconfiguring existing \nrunways, taxiways, or airfield roadways is allowed; and  \n2. New passenger terminals. \na. New passenger terminals for General Aviation are allowed. \nb. New commercial passenger terminals with passenger processing facilities are \nallowed only if they have access directly from Airport Way; if they do not have \naccess directly from Airport Way, they are prohibited.  \n33.565.220 Landscaping \nA. Purpose. Plant selection is an especially important component of the plan district. \nCollisions between birds and aircraft (\"bird strikes\") are a significant hazard to aircraft, \nbirds, and public safety in and around Portland International Airport due to existing natural \nfeatures and ecosystems. In an effort to reduce this hazard, the Airport Plant List provides a \nselection of appropriate plant materials and spacing standards that increase the distance \nbetween plants that may be used in the plan district. The Airport Plant List is part of the \nPortland Plant List. These plants were selected because they are generally non-seeding or \nnon-fruiting and therefore do not attract wildlife. In addition, they do not provide \nattractive roosting habitat for species posing a threat to aviation safety. \nThe airport landscaping standards: \n• Preserve and enhance Portland’s urban forest; \n• Promote the reestablishment of vegetation in urban areas for aesthetic reasons;  \n• Establish and enhance a pleasant visual character which recognizes aesthetics, wildlife \nhazard, and aviation safety issues; \n• Unify development, and enhance and define public and private spaces; and \n• Define the parking and circulation areas \nB. Airport subdistrict. No landscaping is required inside the perimeter fence or within 300 \nfeet of the perimeter fence. All landscaping, screening, and development outside the \nperimeter fence in the Airport Subdistrict must meet the following requirements: \n1. Only trees and shrubs listed in the Airport Plant List section of the Portland Plant List \nmay be planted. An applicant may request to use a tree or shrub not listed in the \nAirport Plant List by using the process outlined in the Airport Plant List. \n2. All trees and shrubs must meet the spacing and diversity requirements of this section.  \n3. Where meeting the spacing standards results in fewer plants or less plant diversity \nthan required by other provisions of this Title, the number of plants required is \nreduced to meet the spacing standard of this section.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.565 \n3/1/20 Portland International Airport Plan District \n \n565-5 \n4. Spacing standards: \na. Non-columnar trees must be planted at a distance of at least 40 feet on center. \nb. Columnar trees must be planted at a distance of at least 25 feet on center. \nc. Evergreen shrubs may be planted adjacent to each other in groups of up to five. \nIf there is more than one group of evergreen shrubs, there must be at least 10  \n \nfeet between each group of shrubs. If shrubs are not planted in groups, there \nmust be at least 10 feet between each shrub. \nd. There must be at least 10 feet between trees and shrubs. \n5. Plant diversity standards \na. Tree diversity \n(1) If there are more than 8 required trees, no more than 40 percent of them \ncan be of one species. If there are more than 24 required trees, no more \nthan 24 percent of them can be of one species. This standard applies only to \ntrees being planted to meet the regulations of this Title, not to  \nexisting trees. \n(2) No more than 20 percent of trees may be evergreen trees.  \nb. Shrub diversity \n(1) No more than 50 percent of shrubs may be evergreen. \n(2) If more than 25 shrubs are required, no more than 75 percent of them can \nbe of one species. \n6. Ground cover. The remainder of the required landscaped area must be planted in \nground cover plants. \n33.565.230 Pedestrian Standards for Specified Uses \nA. Purpose. The pedestrian standards encourage a safe, attractive, and usable pedestrian \ncirculation system for Retail Sales And Service and Office uses. They ensure direct \npedestrian connections among sidewalks, paths used by both bicycles and pedestrians, \nbuildings, and other activities.  \nB. The standards. The pedestrian standards of the EG and EX zones apply to all sites in the \nAirport subdistrict with Retail Sales And Service or Office uses, except: \n1. The standards apply to the area of each ground lease, rather than to each site; and \n2. Paths used by both bicycles and pedestrians may substitute for required sidewalks or \npedestrian-only connections.   Chapter 33.565 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nPortland International Airport Plan District 3/1/20 \n \n565-6 \n33.565.240 Transportation Impact Analysis Review \nA. Purpose. The regulations of this section ensure that the impacts of airport growth on the \nsurface transportation system will be identified and mitigated.  \nB. When an Airport Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) Review is Required. An Airport \nTransportation Impact Analysis Review is required for any proposed development in the \nIG2 zone once the airport begins serving more than 21 Million Annual Passengers (MAP). \nSee Chapter 33.806, Airport Reviews. As part of the review, the Port of Portland may \nrequest approval of development for an additional increment up to 6 MAP. Each time the \nairport begins serving the additional increment of 6 MAP, another TIA Review is required. \nThe Port of Portland may not request approval of an increment larger than 6 MAP.  \n \nThe Port may also request a TIA Review at any time. \nC. Supplemental application requirements. In addition to the application requirements of \nSection 33.730.060, the applicant must submit the following: \n1. A description of proposed development, or growth scenarios; \n2. A Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) that includes the following:  \na. Delineation of the study area, and rationale for the delineation; \nb. Traffic forecasts and distribution; \nc. Where development is proposed, primary traffic access routes to and from the \nstudy area;  \nd. Evaluation of: \n(1) Access requirements; \n(2) Impacts on street function, capacity and level of service; \n(3) Impacts on transit operations and movements; \n(4) Impacts on pedestrian and bicycle routes and safety; and \n(5) Impacts on the immediate airport area and adjacent neighborhoods. \ne. Recommended mitigation measures, including transportation system \nmanagement, transportation demand management, and  \ntransportation improvements. \n33.565.250 Development and Availability of Public Services in the Southwest Quadrant \nA. Purpose. The regulations of this section ensure that adequate public services are available \nprior to development in the Southwest Quadrant. \nB. When a Southwest Quadrant Public Services Review is required. A Southwest Quadrant \nPublic Services Review is required when a proposal will increase development in the land \nside of the Southwest Quadrant by more than 40,000 square feet. The area of development  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.565 \n3/1/20 Portland International Airport Plan District \n \n565-7 \nincludes the square footage of any floor area plus the square footage of any exterior \ndevelopment. See Chapter 33.806, Airport Reviews.  \nSpecial Notification Requirements in the Airport Subdistrict \n33.565.310 Mailed Public Notice for Proposed Development \nWhen development is proposed within the Airport Subdistrict, all of the steps in this section must be \ncompleted before an application for a building or zoning permit is submitted. \nA. Purpose. Mailed public notice informs interested neighborhood associations and district \nneighborhood coalitions of proposed airport development that is not subject to a land use \nreview and provides them with an opportunity to attend a public meeting to get more \ninformation and discuss the proposed development.  \nB. Where and when mailed public notice is required. Proposals that were part of a land use \nreview are exempt from the requirement of this subsection. Mailed public notice is \nrequired in the IG2 zone: \n1. When the proposed development will add more than 10,000 square feet of gross \nbuilding area to the site; or \n2. When the value of the proposed development will exceed $727,050.  \nC. Requirements. The requirements for mailed public notice are: \n1. The applicant must send a letter to the neighborhood associations and district \nneighborhood coalitions of the site or adjacent to the site, by registered or certified \nmail. The letter must contain, at a minimum, contact information for the applicant, \nthe date, time and location that the project will be presented at a public meeting and \na description of the proposed development, including the purpose of the project, total \nproject square footage and project valuation. The letter must be sent at least 14 days \nbefore the public meeting where the project will be presented. \n2. Copies of letters required by this section, and registered or certified mail receipts, \nmust be submitted with the application for building or zoning permit. \n33.565.320 Posted Public Notice Requirements for Land Use Reviews  \nPosting of notice on the site is required for Type III land use reviews. The requirements for posting \nnotices in Section 33.730.080 apply to sites in the plan district zoned IG2; however, the number and \nlocation on the site, specified in Subsection 33.730.080.A, are superseded by the requirements of \nthis section.  \nA. Outdoor notices. Posted notices must be placed at the following outdoor locations:  \n1. At each of the two main crosswalks in the arrivals roadway area; and \n2. At each of the two pedestrian bridges to the P1 parking garage. \nB. Indoor notices. Posted notices must be placed at the following locations inside the terminal \nbuilding and must be visible to passengers and others in the building: \n1. On the second floor of the terminal at each of the two main escalators;  Chapter 33.565 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nPortland International Airport Plan District 3/1/20 \n \n565-8 \n2. On the second floor at each of the two circulation throats; and \n3. On the first floor of the terminal at each of the two main escalators. \nC. Roadway notice. One posted notice must be placed along a roadway within 800 feet of the \nproposed structure or development activity. If the nearest roadway is more than 800 feet \nfrom the proposed structure or development activity, the notice must be placed at the \nintersection closest to the proposed structure or development activity.  \nRegulations in the Middle Columbia Slough Subdistrict \n33.565.400 Zoning Map Amendments \nThe IG2 zone is the only zone that can be requested during a Zoning Map Amendment on the sites \nshown on Map 565-4. Requesting a zone other than IG2 is prohibited. In addition, the Prime \nIndustrial overlay zone must be applied in conjunction with the zone change to IG2. \n33.565.410 Additional Development Standards  \nA. Purpose. The following development standards promote ecologically beneficial design by \nrequiring buffers and plantings that provide ecological function and contribute to \necosystem services such as multi-objective stormwater management, cleaning and cooling \nof air and water, wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and aesthetic values. The development \nstandards help reduce future demands on infrastructure, and reduce adverse impacts from \ndevelopment both on and off-site. The standards also buffer industrial development from \nabutting residential development and open space uses, and provide a pleasant work \nenvironment for employees.  \nB. Where the standards apply. The standards in this Section apply to development in the IG2 \nzone in the Golf Course/IG2 Transition Area shown on Map 565-4. \nC. Development standards. \n1. Minimum landscaped area standard. At least 20 percent of site area must be landscaped. \nArea improved for active or passive recreational use, or for use by pedestrians, does not \ncount toward the required landscaped area. Other required landscaping, such as setbacks \nand parking lot landscaping, applies toward the landscaped area standard. Area covered \nby an eco-roof also applies toward the landscaped area standard. \n2. Native plants. At least 75 percent of all plants planted to meet Title 33 landscaping \nrequirements must be native plants from the Portland Plant List.  \n3. Vegetated setback.  \na. All development must be set back 25 feet from a residential zone or open space \nzone. The area within the vegetated setback may be applied toward the required \nlandscaped area standards;  \nb. Required plants and planting densities. One of the following standards must  \nbe met:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.565 \n3/1/20 Portland International Airport Plan District \n \n565-9 \n(1) One tree, three shrubs, and four other ground cover plants are required to be \nplanted for every 100 square feet of setback area. Trees may be clustered. \nPlants must be native plants from the Portland Plant List; or \n(2) One tree and three shrubs are required to be planted for every 100 square feet \nof setback area, and the entire setback area must be seeded with a native grass  \nand forb seed mix at a ratio of 30 pounds per acre. Trees may be clustered. \nPlants and seeds must be native plants from the Portland Plant  \nList; and \nc. One-third of all trees planted must be native conifer trees from the  \nPortland Plant List.  \n4. Exterior lighting. Exterior lights must be shielded and placed so that they do not shine \nupward or into environmental overlay zones, or into the vegetated setback area required \nby Paragraph C.3. \nEnvironmental Overlay Zones \n33.565.500 Purpose  \nThe environmental regulations in the Portland International Airport plan district work in conjunction \nwith the standards of Chapter 33.430 to: \n• Protect inventoried significant natural resources and their functional values specific to the \nplan district, as identified in the Comprehensive Plan;  \n• Address activities required to manage Port facilities, drainageways and wildlife on and \naround the airfield for public and avian safety;  \n• Address resource mitigation and enhancement opportunities consistent with managing \nwildlife and vegetation on and around the airfield for public safety; and \n• Encourage coordination between City, county, regional, state, and federal agencies \nconcerned with airport safety and natural resources. \n• Protect inventoried significant archaeological resources where those resources overlap with \nan environmental protection zone or environmental conservation zone. \n33.565.510 Relationship to Other Environmental Regulations \nThe regulations of Sections 33.565.510 through 33.565.620 either supplement or supersede the \nregulations of Chapter 33.430.

Procedure type. Within the Airport Subdistrict, all activities required in order to implement \nan FAA authorized Wildlife Hazard Management Plan within the resource area or transition \narea of the conservation or protection overlay zones that require environmental review are \nprocessed through the Type II procedure.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.565 \n3/1/20 Portland International Airport Plan District \n \n565-15 \nB. Application requirements. Within the Airport Subdistrict and for activities required to \nimplement an FAA authorized Wildlife Hazard Management Plan, an alternatives analysis is \nnot required. Specifically, instead of the supplemental narrative requirements of \n33.430.230.B, the following is required: \n1. Activity description. Describe the activity and why it is necessary to implement an FAA \nauthorized Wildlife Hazard Management Plan; \n2. Documentation of resources and functional values. Documentation of resources and \nfunctional values is required to determine compliance with the approval criteria. In \nthe case of a violation, documentation of resources and functional values is used to \ndetermine the nature and scope of significant detrimental impacts.  \na. Identification, by characteristics and quantity, of the resources and their \nfunctional values found on the site; \nb. In the case of a violation, determination of the impact of the violation on the \nresources and functional values.  \n3. Construction management plan. Identify measures that will be taken during the \nactivity or remediation to protect the remaining resources and functional values at \nand near the site and a description of how undisturbed areas will be protected. For \nexample, describe how trees will be protected, erosion controlled, equipment \ncontrolled, and the timing of activity; and \n4. Mitigation or remediation plan. The purpose of a mitigation or remediation plan is to \ncompensate for unavoidable significant detrimental impacts that result from the \nchosen activity or violation as identified in the impact evaluation. A mitigation or \nremediation plan includes: \na. Resources and functional values to be restored, created, or enhanced on the \nmitigation or remediation site; \nb. Documentation of coordination with appropriate local, regional, special district, \nstate, and federal regulatory agencies; \nc. Activity timetables; \nd. Operations and maintenance practices; \ne. Monitoring and evaluation procedures; \nf. Remedial actions for unsuccessful mitigation; and \ng. Information showing compliance with Section 33.248.090, Mitigation and \nRestoration Plantings. \nC. Approval criteria. The following approval criteria apply to activities required in order to \nimplement an FAA authorized Wildlife Hazard Management Plan within the resource area \nor transition area of the conservation or protection overlay zones that require \nenvironmental review. These criteria supersede the criteria in 33.430.250.E and F: \n1. There will be no significant detrimental impact on resources and functional values in \nareas designated to be left undisturbed;   Chapter 33.565 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nPortland International Airport Plan District 3/1/20 \n \n565-16 \n2. The mitigation plan demonstrates that all significant detrimental impacts on resources \nand functional values will be compensated for; \n3. Mitigation will occur within the same watershed as the proposed use or development \nand within the Portland city limits except when the purpose of the mitigation could be \nbetter provided elsewhere; and \n4. The applicant owns the mitigation site; possesses a legal instrument that is approved \nby the City (such as an easement or deed restriction) sufficient to carry out and ensure \nthe success of the mitigation program; or can demonstrate legal authority to acquire \nproperty through eminent domain. \nNotice and Review Procedure for Permits Within Environmental Overlay Zones \n33.565.600 Purpose \nThe purpose of this notice and review procedure is to notify the public of the permit review process \nfor development proposed in areas having identified significant resources and functional values. \n33.565.610 When These Regulations Apply \nThese regulations apply when a building permit or development permit application is requested \nwithin an environmental overlay zone and is subject to the Development Standards of Section \n33.430.110 through .190, 33.430.405.B, or 33.430.405.C, or 33.565.510 through .580.

Chapter 33.566  Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nPortland International Raceway Plan District  6/13/05 \n \n566‐2 \n The natural, grassy, open areas provide food and some shelter for wildlife, and also help to \naccommodate the occasional larger recreational events. Primarily, however, these areas \nprovide a special experience of an open, undeveloped, and natural setting for those who are \nwithin it, or those who are viewing it from the racetrack core area.  \n The racetrack core area provides both recreational and entertainment opportunities for the \nregion. This is the part of PIR that is used most regularly for recreation, and is the part where \ndevelopment and year‐round activity can be the most intense. This area includes the paved \nand grass area in the southeastern corner, the infield area including the paddock and moto‐\ncross track, the road connecting the north entrance to the paddock, and the racetrack itself. \nThe racetrack is used for major racing events, and also for many functions of local motor \nsports clubs and service organizations. This area provides an opportunity for active, intense, \nand vibrant uses, while preserving and enhancing the natural setting and highlighting the \nexperience of the transition between them. Part of the experience for those within this area \nis the sights, sounds, and excitement that are inherent to a racetrack; part of the experience \nis the contrast with the natural setting that serves as a backdrop to  \nthis area.  \n \nThe key to achieving the purpose of this plan district—to preserve and enhance the special character \nand opportunities of this unique area—goes beyond simply requiring that development within the \nracetrack core area not negatively affect the other areas; it requires a careful design and balancing \nso that, on one hand, the recreational and entertainment uses do not overwhelm the overall natural \nsetting, and the natural setting continues to enhance the recreational and entertainment uses.  \n33.566.020 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to the Portland International Raceway (PIR) plan district. The \nboundaries of the plan district are shown on Map 566‐1 at the end of this chapter, and on the \nOfficial Zoning Maps. \n33.566.030 Relationship to Other Regulations \nDevelopment in the plan district must also comply with the requirements of Chapter 33.430, \nEnvironmental Overlay Zones, and the Natural Resources Management Plan for Peninsula Drainage \nDistrict No. 1. \n33.566.100 Additional Allowed Uses \nA racetrack for motor vehicles is an additional allowed use.  \n33.566.110 PIR Master Plan Required \nAll development within the PIR plan district must be master planned, except as listed in this section. \nThe PIR Master Plan must be approved before any other development takes place. The PIR Master \nPlan must be approved under the procedures set forth in Section 33.566.200, PIR Master Plan. The \nfollowing development and activities are allowed before approval of a PIR Master Plan: \nA.  Filling holes outside of environmental zones, as necessary for public safety; \nB.  Erecting temporary or permanent fencing outside of environmental zones for purposes of \ncrowd control and safety; \nC.  Normal maintenance and repair of the Raceway and associated facilities; and

Purpose \n33.567.020 Where the Regulations Apply \n33.567.040 Construction of Noise-Buffering Walls \nMap 567-1 Powell Boulevard Plan District  \n33.567.010 Purpose \nThe regulations of the Powell Boulevard plan district are intended to buffer residences from the \nnoise and traffic of Powell Boulevard. The regulations of this chapter support the intent of the \nhighway improvements which widened Powell Boulevard and created public off-street parking. The \nPowell Boulevard Environmental Impact Statement required noise protection for the adjacent \nresidential neighborhood. \n33.567.020 Where the Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to the Powell Boulevard plan district area. The boundaries of \nthe plan district are shown on Map 567-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the Official  \nZoning Maps. \n33.567.040 Construction of Noise-Buffering Walls \nThe construction of a noise-buffering wall is required for new development as follows: \nA. Location. A wall is required along any lot line parallel to Powell Boulevard that abuts an R \nzone. A wall is also required on street lot lines that are across a local service street from an \nR zone. This regulation only applies to local service streets that are south of and parallel to \nPowell Boulevard. See Figure 567-1. \nB. Standards. The wall must be solid, continuous, a minimum of 8 feet high, and extend the \nentire length of the lot line. The design of the wall must be compatible with the existing \nwalls constructed by the State. \nC. Landscaping. For walls along a street lot line, a 5 foot area landscaped to the L3 standard \nmust be provided on the street side of the wall. The landscape standards are stated in \nChapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening. The landscaped area is intended to screen the \nwall from the residential area. See Figure 567-1. \nD. Buildings integrated into the wall. Where a rear lot line abuts the rear lot line of a \nresidential zone, a building with a height of no more than 10 feet may be integrated into \nthe design of the wall.

The regulations relating to Rocky \nButte are intended to preserve and enhance the forested areas of the butte, views from the butte, \nhistoric architectural elements, and the natural scenic qualities of the butte. \n33.570.020 Where the Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to development within the Rocky Butte plan district. The \nboundaries of the district are shown on Map 570-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the Official \nZoning Maps. Any changes to land or development, including rights-of-way, within the Rocky Butte \nplan district are subject to the regulations of this Chapter. \n33.570.030 Development Standards \nA. Tree preservation plan. A tree preservation plan must be submitted at the time of \napplication for a required land use review or at the time of application for a building \npermit, whichever occurs first. The tree preservation plan must show all individual trees \ngreater than 6 inches in diameter at five feet above the ground. As an option to showing \nindividual trees in areas not being disturbed, the crown cover outline of trees can be \nshown. Trees to be preserved or removed must be shown as such on the plan.  \nB. Height of structures. The maximum height of structures on a portion of Rocky Butte is \ndetermined by the elevation of the adjacent roadway. All structures, including antennas, \nchimneys, flag poles and satellite dishes, may not extend above the level of the adjacent \nroadway in locations shown on Map 570-1 and described as follows: \n Lying in Section 28 adjacent to Rocky Butte Road on the south and southeast sides \nbetween Engineer's Station No. 70 and Engineer's Station No. 80, on the west side of the \nsaid road between Engineer's Station No. 80 and Engineer's Station No. 83 + 50, and on the \nnorth, east and west sides between Station No. 88 and Engineer's Station No. 99 + 33. \nC. Street setback. The following must be met where a front or side lot line abuts NE Rocky \nButte Road:  Chapter 33.570 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRocky Butte Plan District 1/1/15 \n \n570-2 \n1. No more than 25 percent of the front or side building setback can be used for parking, \nmaneuvering and circulation areas. For lots with an average slope down of 20 percent \nor more, the maximum area devoted to parking, maneuvering and circulation is 35 \npercent of the front or side building setback.  \n2. The remainder of the front or side setback must be landscaped to at least the L1 level. \nEmphasis should be placed on the use of native species as listed on the  \nPortland Plant List. \nD. Access limitations. As a part of any new partition or subdivision of land, access to the ring \nroad portion of Rocky Butte Road is limited in order to preserve on-street parking and \nmaintain the forest setting. All lots created by any partitioning or subdivision of land must \nobtain vehicular access from a public or private street other than the ring road portion of \nRocky Butte Road. For each 1000 feet of property frontage abutting the ring portion of \nRocky Butte Road there may not be more than one intersection with a public or private \nstreet. \nE. Lighting. Cut-off luminars must be installed for any outdoor lighting fixtures on private \nproperty. On private property, glare may not directly, or indirectly from reflection, cause \nillumination on other properties in excess of a measurement of .5 foot candles of light. In \nthe right-of-way, illumination may not exceed .5 average horizontal footcandles (Eh Ave) \nover an area 10 feet deep, adjacent to public rights-of-way. Lighting for the purpose of \nensuring public safety is exempt from this standard. \nF. Fences. Wire and/or metal fences are not allowed. \nG. Screening. Outdoor storage and parking of recreational vehicles and utility trailers, \nincluding motor homes, campers, and boats, is not allowed if visible at any time of the year \nfrom NE Rocky Butte Road or the top of Rocky Butte. All garbage cans, garbage collection \nareas, and mechanical equipment (including heat pumps, air conditioners, emergency \ngenerators, and water pumps) must be screened from view or not visible from Rocky Butte \nRoad or the top of the butte. Small rooftop mechanical equipment, including vents, need \nnot be screened if the total area of such equipment does not exceed 10 square feet  \nper structure. \n33.570.040 Tree Removal \nA. Purpose. The heavily forested slopes of Rocky Butte contribute to the beauty of the area, \ncreate a striking landmark as one enters or leaves Portland, and provides the natural \nsetting to complement the historic features of the butte. The purpose of this Section is to \nallow trees to be removed only when they meet the purpose of the Rocky Butte plan \ndistrict and this Section. Every effort should be made to locate buildings, easements, \nparking strips, sidewalks and vehicle areas to preserve the maximum number of trees. \nB. Tree removal review. Trees in the Rocky Butte plan district that do not qualify for removal \nunder Subsection C, below, may be removed if approved through tree review as provided \nin Chapter 33.853, Tree Review. However, where tree removal would also require \nenvironmental review, only environmental review is required.  \nC. Tree removal standards. Trees 6 or more inches in diameter may not be removed unless \none or more of the following are met:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.570 \n1/1/15 Rocky Butte Plan District \n \n570-3 \n1. The tree is located within the footprint or within 10 feet of existing or proposed \nbuildings and structures attached to buildings, such as decks, stairs, and carports, or \nwithin 10 feet of a proposed driveway; \n2. The tree is determined by an arborist to be dead, dying, or dangerous; \n3. The tree is listed on the Nuisance Plants List; \n4. The tree must be removed for installation, repair or maintenance of water, sewer, or \nstormwater services. For new installation of services, tree removal allowed under this \nprovision is limited to a single 10 foot wide utility corridor per site;  \n5. The tree is within a proposed roadway or City-required construction easement, \nincluding areas devoted to curbs, parking strips, sidewalks, or vehicle areas; or \n6. The tree is at least 6 and up to 12 inches in diameter and does not meet any of the \nother standards of this Subsection, but is replaced with two trees. Replacement \nplantings must meet Section 33.248.030, Plant Materials. \nD. Tree removal without development. When no development is proposed, tree removal \nallowed by the standards of Subsection C.1 through 5, above, is subject to the tree permit \nrequirements of Title 11, Trees. \n33.570.050 Historic Features Review \nA. Purpose. The hewn basalt blocks that line portions of Rocky Butte, the low basalt walls, the \nbasalt retaining walls, bollards, drainage ways, the pedestrian and vehicle tunnels and \nother similar features are part of the scenic and historic character of the butte. The \npurpose of the historic features review is to ensure that these features are not altered in \nany way that will diminish the historic quality of the butte. Where features need to be \nremoved temporarily or permanently in order to allow development, the review ensures \nthat the impact of the removal is mitigated.  \nB. Scope of historic features review. Historic features review is required for the alteration or \nremoval of historic features that are on private property. For those historic features owned \nand maintained by the City and located in the public right-of-way, the City Engineer must \nseek the advice of the Historic Landmarks Commission prior to making any substantive \nalteration or removal. The Historical Landmarks Commission will consider the approval \ncriteria of this subsection in providing advice to the City Engineer. The City Engineer is not \nrequired to seek this advice for routine maintenance and emergency repairs to these \nhistoric features when they are performed by the City.  \nC. Procedure. Historic Features review is processed through a Type III procedure.  \nD. Approval criteria. The request to alter or remove historic features on the butte will be \napproved if the applicant has shown that all the following approval criteria are met: \n1. There is a clear demonstration that there is a public need for the proposal and that \nthe public benefit resulting from the proposal outweighs the benefits of preserving \nthe historic features.  Chapter 33.570 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRocky Butte Plan District 1/1/15 \n \n570-4 \n2. Alternative locations, design modifications, or alternative methods of development \nthat would reduce the impacts on the historic features have been identified and \nevaluated. \n3. Impacts on the historic features have been mitigated through replacing or relocating \nthe removed historic feature or through enhancing other nearby historic features. \n33.570.070 Relationship to Environmental Zones \nWhen an environmental zone has been applied at the location of a designated scenic resource, the \nenvironmental review must include consideration of the scenic qualities of the resource as \nidentified in the ESEE Analysis for Scenic Resources. The development standards of this Chapter \nmust be considered as part of that review. \n \n(Added by Ord. No. 163957, effective 4/12/91. Amended by: Ord. No. 166572, effective 6/25/93; \nOrd.

In \nthis case, adjustments to increase the height by more than 20 percent of the maximum \nbuilding height limit shown on Map 583-2, or 10 feet, whichever is greater, are prohibited. \n33.583.270 Building Coverage in the CM3 Zone \nA. Purpose. The building coverage standard works with the FAR and height standards to \ncontrol the overall scale and bulk of development and promote development consistent \nwith the desired character of the plan district. These standards ensure that buildings do not \ncompletely cover a site. \nB. Maximum building coverage. The maximum building coverage in the CM3 zone is  \n85 percent. \n33.583.280 Residential Uses in the EG1 Zone \nA. Purpose. This regulation provides flexibility in the use of structures in the EG1 zone to \nfacilitate live/work development in an overall employment setting. The standards ensure \nthat allowed residential uses will not dominate a site or area. \nB. Where these regulations apply. These regulations apply in the EG1 zone outside the \nRiverfront Subdistrict. \nC. Residential uses. Up to one-third of the floor area on the site may be in residential use, up \nto a maximum FAR of 0.5 to 1, and a maximum density of 1 dwelling unit for each 10,000 \nsquare feet of site area. \n33.583.285 Additional Regulations in the Riverfront Subdistrict \nA. Purpose. These regulations allow the Riverfront Subdistrict to continue to accommodate \nindustrial uses, but foster the transition to an urban mixed-use area that is well integrated \ninto St. Johns.  \nB. Where these regulations apply. The regulations of this section apply to sites in the \nRiverfront Subdistrict, shown on Map 583-1. \nC. Minimum residential density in the CM3 zone.

The shipyard is a primary industry dependent on the Willamette River. Activities \noccurring in the shipyard cover a range that runs from heavy industrial to temporary housing for the \ncrews of ships undergoing repair or refitting. The variety of sizes and types of ships and industrial \nconstruction projects attracted to the shipyard frequently requires that the area be reconfigured. \nThe provisions of the Swan Island Plan District are intended to foster the growth and \ncompetitiveness of this unique waterfront basic industry. The provisions of this plan district replace \nthe Swan Island Development Program’s provisions affecting the transportation and circulation \ncomponents of the island’s development within the plan district.  \n33.585.020 Where the Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to the Swan Island Plan District. The boundaries of the plan \ndistrict are shown on Map 585-1 at the end of this chapter, and on the Official Zoning Maps. \n Use Regulations \n33.585.030 Additional Allowed Primary Uses  \nA. Purpose. Because the demand for use of the ship repair facilities is not constant it is in the \npublic interest to allow nonriver-related or nonriver-dependent activities to temporarily \nuse the underutilized portions of the repair yard facility.  \nB. Additional primary uses allowed. Within the Swan Island Plan District the following \nconstruction activities that are not river-related and river-dependent are permitted: \nconstruction of modular housing, large scale metal fabrication of such things as cranes, \nbridge trusses and spans, platforms and derricks, and military and aeronautics machinery.  Chapter 33.585 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nSwan Island Plan District 4/15/00 \n \n585-2 \n33.585.040 Additional Allowed Accessory Uses  \nA. Purpose. The nature of the ship repair activity brings to the site the ship’s crews whose \nliving quarters are on board vessels which are being repaired. The large size and unique \nnature of the activity requires more flexibility in the area of accessory use activities than \nare allowed by the yard's industrial zoning. \nB. Additional accessory uses. The following additional accessory uses are allowed within the \nSwan Island Plan District. \n1. Office: Temporary (up to 2 years) office trailers, office space for contractors and \nsubcontractors, offices of naval architects, testing services and government offices. \n2. Household or Group Living: Temporary (up to 2 years) housing for Navy and other \nvessel crews. Housing is allowed only if associated with a ship  \nrepair/refurbishing project.  \n3. Industrial Services: Welding, machine tooling, metalworking, carpentry, plumbing, and \nother building activities supporting a ship repair or other large construction project \noccurring in the shipyard are allowed for up to 2 years. Surface preparation and \npainting of ships and other equipment being constructed in the ship repair yards. \nWarehousing of materials and supplies needed for ship repair and fabrication \nprojects. Exterior storage and laydown areas for ship’s and contractor’s equipment \nand supplies. Temporary storage of equipment used to cleanup or manage hazardous \nwaste. In-ground fuel tanks and pumps for shipyard tenants. Grit storage and handling \nand grit recycling. Barge-mounted surface preparation and coating facilities. \nTemporary storage of vehicles and equipment.  \nDevelopment Standards \n33.585.050 Landscaping Within the Greenway Setback \nA. Purpose. The Portland Ship Repair facilities are designed to allow their flexible \nmodification and reconfiguration. This flexibility is essential both for the shipyard’s ability \nto accommodate multiple concurrent projects and its ability to accommodate the wide \nvariety of ship types and sizes that are attracted to its facilities. The City’s greenway zone \nregulations assume that developed property along the Willamette will be relatively stable \nin its configuration and require that activities that are not water-related or water-\ndependent be separated from the top of the river’s bank by a landscaped greenway \nsetback. The regulations of this section are intended to accommodate the ongoing changes \nin facility configuration inherent in the shipyard’s operations while also addressing the \nappearance and character of the Willamette’s riverbank. \nB. Alternative greenway setback landscaping requirements. As an alternative to compliance \nwith Section 33.440.210 Greenway Setback, a riverbank development mitigation plan may \nbe developed and implemented.

Purpose. These standards provide additional buffering between zones that allow residential \nuse and zones that do not allow residential use. The standards increase separation and soften \nthe edges between residential and nonresidential uses. The separation is achieved by \nincreasing setbacks, limiting motor vehicle access, and requiring additional landscaping, which \nalso provides greening and climate benefits.  \nB. Where these standards apply. These standards apply to lots zoned EX that have lot lines that \nabut lots zoned EG1 or EG2, and on split zoned lots that are split between EX and EG1 zoning.  \nC. Setbacks and landscaping.  \n1. In Subdistricts B and D, the following setback and landscaping standards apply: \na. On EX zoned lots that have lot lines that abut lots in Subdistrict A that are zoned EG1 \nor EG2, a 20 foot setback landscaped to at least the L1 standard is required along all \nlots lines that abut the EG1 or EG2 zones. Only the L1 medium tree standard and \nlarge tree standard may be used to meet this standard. \nb. Within the EX portion of split zoned lots that are split between EX and EG1, a 20 foot \nsetback landscaped to at least the L1 standard is required along the zone line \nsplitting EX and EG1.

Windows into bicycle parking areas \nare allowed to qualify for up to 25 percent of the ground floor windows coverage requirement. \nThe bottom of the windows of nonresidential spaces must be no more than 4 feet above the \nfinished grade. \n1. Ground level facades that are located within 100 feet of and face the main street shown \non Map 597-2 must have windows that cover at least 60 percent of the ground level wall \narea. For the purposes of this standard, ground level wall area includes all exterior wall \narea from 2 feet to 10 feet above the finished grade. Until January 1, 2029, the standard \nfor development that includes a residential use is 40 percent of the ground level wall area. \n2. All other ground level facades that face a street lot line, sidewalk, plaza, or other publicly \naccessible open area or right-of-way must have windows that cover at least 40 percent of \nthe ground level wall area. For street facing facades of dwelling units the regulations of \n33.130.230.B.4 apply. For the purposes of this standard, ground level wall area includes all \nexterior wall area from 2 feet to 10 feet above the finished grade. \n3. Optional artwork. Projects proposing to use artwork as an alternative to the ground floor \nwindow requirements may apply for this through the adjustment procedure. Projects may \nalso apply for a modification through design review if they meet the following \nqualifications. Buildings having more than 50 percent of their ground level space in \nstorage, parking, or loading areas, or in uses which by their nature are not conducive to \nwindows (such as theaters), may be allowed to use the design review process. Artwork \nand displays relating to activities occurring within the building are encouraged. In these \ninstances, the artwork will be allowed if it is found to be consistent with the purpose for \nthe ground floor window standard. \nD. Ground floor active use standard. In order to accommodate active uses such as residential, \nretail, or office, the ground floor of buildings must be designed and constructed as follows. This \nstandard must be met along at least 50 percent of the ground floor of walls that are at an angle \nof 45 degrees or less from the street lot line of the main street shown on Map 597-2. \nDevelopment that includes a residential use is exempt from the ground floor active use \nstandard until January 1, 2029: \nAreas designed to accommodate active uses must meet the following standards: \n1. The distance from the finished floor to the bottom of the structure above must be at least \n12 feet. The bottom of the structure above includes supporting beams; \n2. The area must be at least 25 feet deep, measured from the street-facing façade; \n3. At least 25 percent of the area of the street-facing façade of the portion of the building \ndesigned to meet the requirements of this subsection must be windows and doors; and \n4. Parking is not allowed in the areas designed to meet the standards of this subsection.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.597 \n6/1/25 York Plan District \n \n597-13 \n33.597.255 Standards near the Streetcar Alignment \nA. Purpose.

Motor vehicle access to a vehicle area or structure is not allowed from \nthe streetcar alignment shown on Map 597-2 except when the site has no other street \nfrontage. \n33.597.260 Urban Green Features \nA. Purpose. Green elements integrated into the urban environment help to soften the effects of \nbuilt and paved areas, cool the air temperature, intercept rainfall and reduce stormwater \nrunoff by providing unpaved permeable surface. They may also provide opportunities to grow \nfood and provide habitat for birds and other wildlife. A range of urban green options are \nprovided to address this area’s more urban development patterns and characteristics.  \nB. Where these options apply. The standard applies to new development and alterations to \ndevelopment in Subdistricts B, C, D, E, and F when more than 10,000 square feet of floor area \nwill be added to a site. \nC. Urban green features standard. Development must include at least one of the following: \n1. Landscaped area. A minimum of 15 percent of a site area must be landscaped. Any \nrequired landscaping, such as for required setbacks or parking lots, applies towards \nmeeting the minimum amount of landscaping required for this option. Sites developed \nwith a house, attached house or duplex are exempt from the landscaped area option. The \nfollowing apply: \na. Landscaped areas must be at ground level and comply with at least the L1 standard \ndescribed in Chapter 33.248, Landscaping and Screening, or be a vegetated \nstormwater management facility that meets minimum Bureau of Environmental \nServices stormwater management requirements.

These requirements ensure that lots are consistent \nwith the desired character of each zone while allowing lots to vary in size and shape provided the \nplanned intensity of each zone is respected. This chapter works in conjunction with other chapters \nof this Title to ensure that land divisions create lots that can support appropriate uses and \ndevelopment. \n33.610.020 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to land divisions in the RF through R2.5 zones. \n33.610.100 Density Standards \nA. Purpose. Density standards match housing density with the availability of services and with \nthe carrying capacity of the land in order to promote efficient use of land, and maximize \nthe benefits to the public from investment in infrastructure and services. These standards \npromote development opportunities for housing and promote urban densities in less \ndeveloped areas. Maximum densities ensure that the number of lots created does not \nexceed the intensity planned for the area, given the base zone, overlay zone, and plan \ndistrict regulations. Minimum densities ensure that enough dwelling units can be \ndeveloped to accommodate the projected need for housing.  \nB. Generally.  \n1. The method used to calculate density depends on whether a street is created as part \nof the land division. As used in this chapter, creation of a street means a full street on \nthe site, creating the first stage of a partial width street on the site, or extending an \nexisting street onto the site. It does not include additional stages of a partial width \nstreet, or dedicating right-of-way to widen an existing right-of-way.  \n2. To be eligible for maximum density A, the site being divided must qualify for a primary \nstructure in conformance with 33.110.202, When Primary Structures are Allowed.  \n3. When lots will be created using more than one maximum density, maximum density is \ncalculated separately for the area being divided under each maximum density. When \nstreets are created, density is calculated separately after deducting for streets.  Chapter 33.610 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nLots in RF Through R2.5 Zones 1/1/25 \n \n610-2 \n \nC. No street created. Where no street will be created as part of the land division, the \nfollowing maximum and minimum density standards apply. Adjustments to this subsection \nare prohibited: \n1. Maximum density. Maximum density is based on the zone and the size of the site. The \nfollowing formula is used to determine the maximum number of lots allowed on the \nsite: \nSquare footage of site; \n÷ Maximum density A, B, or C from Table 610-1; \n= Maximum number of lots allowed. \n2. Minimum density. Minimum density is based on the zone and size of the site, and \nwhether there are physical constraints. The following formula is used to determine \nthe minimum number of lots required on the site. Exceptions to minimum density are \nallowed under the provisions of Subsection 33.610.100.E:  \nSquare footage of site; \n- Square footage of site within an Environmental or River Environmental, or Pleasant \nValley Natural Resources overlay zone, potential landslide hazard area, or \ncombined flood hazard area; \nx 0.80; \n÷ Maximum density C from Table 610-1; \n= Minimum number of lots required. \nD. Street created. Where a street will be created as part of the land division, the following \nmaximum and minimum density standards apply. Pedestrian connections that are self-\ncontained streets created solely for the use of pedestrians and bicyclists are not considered \nstreets for the purposes of calculating density under this subsection. Adjustments to this \nsubsection are prohibited:  \n1. Maximum density. Maximum density is based on the zone, the size of the site and \nwhether a street is being created. The following formula is used to determine the \nmaximum number of lots allowed on the site:  \nSquare footage of site; \nx 0.85; \n÷ Maximum density A, B, or C from Table 610-1; \n= Maximum number of lots allowed. \n2. Minimum density. Minimum density is based on the zone, the size of the site, whether \nthere are physical constraints, and whether a street is being created. The following \nformula is used to determine the minimum number of lots required on the site. \nExceptions to minimum density are allowed under the provisions of Subsection \n33.610.100.E: \nSquare footage of site \n- Square footage of site within an Environmental or River Environmental, or Pleasant \nValley Natural Resources overlay zone, potential landslide hazard area, or \ncombined flood hazard area; \nx 0.68 \n÷ Maximum density C from Table 610-1 \n= Minimum number of lots required.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.610 \n1/1/25 Lots in RF Through R2.5 Zones \n \n610-3 \nE. Exceptions to minimum density. Exceptions to minimum density standards are allowed in \nthe following situations. Adjustments to this subsection are prohibited: \n1. If the minimum required density is equal to the maximum allowed density, then the \nminimum is automatically reduced by one;  \n2. If the minimum required density is larger than the maximum allowed density, then the \nminimum density is automatically reduced to one less than the maximum; \n3. The portion of the site that has a conditional use or Conditional Use Master Plan is not \nincluded in the site for calculations of minimum density. \n \nTable 610-1 \nMaximum Density Standards  \n RF R20 R10 R7 R5 R2.5 \nMaximum Density A: \nMaximum density for lots that  \n• Will be developed with \nattached houses; \n• Will be located entirely \noutside the Constrained \nSites overlay zone; and \n• Will have frontage on a \nmaintained street, a private \nstreet that connects to a \nmaintained street, or a self-\ncontained pedestrian \nconnection created solely \nfor pedestrians and bicycles.  \n \nNA 1 lot per \n5,000  \nsq. ft. \n1 lot per \n2,500  \nsq. ft.  \n1 lot per \n1,750  \nsq. ft.  \n1 lot per \n1,500  \nsq. ft. \n1 lot per \n1,500  \nsq. ft. \nMaximum Density B:  \nMaximum density for lots that \nwill be developed with \nattached houses.  \nNA 1 lot per \n10,000  \nsq. ft. \n1 lot per \n5,000  \nsq. ft. \n1 lot per \n3,500  \nsq. ft. \n1 lot per \n2,500  \nsq. ft. \n1 lot per \n2,000  \nsq. ft. \nMaximum Density C: \nMaximum density for all other \nlots \n1 lot per \n87,120  \nsq. ft. \n1 lot per \n20,000  \nsq. ft. \n1 lot per \n10,000  \nsq. ft. \n1 lot per \n7,000  \nsq. ft. \n1 lot per \n5,000  \nsq. ft. \n1 lot per \n2,500  \nsq. ft. \n \n33.610.200 Lot Dimension Regulations \nLots in the RF through R2.5 zones must meet the lot dimension regulations of this section.  \nA. Purpose. The lot dimension regulations ensure that: \n• Each lot has enough room for a reasonably-sized house; \n• Lots are of a size and shape that development on each lot can meet the development \nstandards of the zoning code;  \n• Lots are not so large that they seem to be able to be further divided to exceed the \nmaximum allowed density of the site in the future; \n• Lots that can be divided in the future without exceeding the maximum allowed density \nfor the original land division site are of a size and shape to reasonably be divided;   Chapter 33.610 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nLots in RF Through R2.5 Zones 1/1/25 \n \n610-4 \n \n• Each lot has room for at least a small, private outdoor area; \n• Lots are compatible with the planned intensity of the zone; \n• Lots are wide enough to allow development to orient toward the street; \n• Lots don’t narrow to an unbuildable width close to the street \n• Each lot has adequate access from the street;  \n• Each lot has access for utilities and services; \n• Lots are not landlocked; and \n• Lots are regularly shaped. \n \nTable 610-2 \nLot Dimension Standards  \n RF R20 R10 R7 R5 R2.5 \nMinimum Lot Area \nAttached house lots [1] \n \nAll other lots \n \nNA \n \n52,000  \nsq. ft. \n \n1,500  \nsq. ft.  \n12,000  \nsq. ft. \n \n1,500  \nsq. ft. \n6,000  \nsq. ft. \n \n1,500  \nsq. ft.  \n4,200  \nsq. ft. \n \n1,500  \nsq. ft.  \n3,000  \nsq. ft. \n \n1,500  \nsq. ft.  \n1,500  \nsq. ft. \nMaximum Lot Area \nCottage cluster lots [2] \n \nAll other lots \n \nNA \n \n151,000  \nsq. ft. \n \n43,560  \nsq. ft. \n34,500  \nsq. ft. \n \n43,560  \nsq. ft. \n17,000  \nsq. ft. \n \n43,560  \nsq. ft. \n12,000  \nsq. ft. \n \n43,560  \nsq. ft. \n8,500  \nsq. ft. \n \n43,560  \nsq. ft. \nNA \nMinimum Lot Width [3] \nAttached house lots [1] \nAll other lots \n \nNA \n60 ft. \n \n15 ft. \n60 ft. \n \n15 ft. \n50 ft. \n \n15 ft. \n40 ft. \n \n15 ft. \n36 ft.  \n \n15 ft. \n25 ft. \nMinimum Front Lot Line \nAttached house lots [1] \nAll other lots \n \nNA \n30 ft. \n \n15 ft. \n30 ft. \n \n15 ft. \n30 ft. \n \n15 ft. \n30 ft. \n \n15 ft. \n30 ft. \n \n15 ft. \n20 ft. \nMinimum Lot Depth 60 ft. 60 ft. 60 ft. 55 ft. 50 ft. 40 ft. \nNotes: \n[1] This dimensional standard is only allowed for lots that will be developed with attached houses. \n[2] This dimensional standard is only allowed for lots that are located entirely outside the Constrained Sites \noverlay zone, have frontage on a maintained street or a private street that connects to a maintained street or \na self-contained pedestrian connection created solely for pedestrians and bicycles, and will be developed \nwith cottage clusters. \n[3] See 33.930.100.A for how lot width is measured. \n \nB. Minimum lot area. Each lot must meet the minimum lot area standard stated in Table 610-\n2. Lots that do not meet the minimum lot area standard may be requested through \nPlanned Development Review or, when the site is in an environmental overlay zone, as a \nmodification through environmental review. Until January 2, 2032, adjustments to reduce \nthe minimum lot area standard by up to 10 percent may be requested. Other than as \nspecified in this Subsection, adjustments are prohibited. \nC. Maximum lot area. Lots larger than the maximum lot area standards stated in Table 610-2 \nare not allowed. Lots with a conditional use or Conditional Use Master Plan are exempt \nfrom the maximum lot area standard.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.610 \n1/1/25 Lots in RF Through R2.5 Zones \n \n610-5 \nD. Minimum lot width. Each lot must meet the minimum lot width standard stated in Table \n610-2. Lots that do not meet the standard may be requested through Planned \nDevelopment Review or, when the site is in an environmental overlay zone, as a \nmodification through environmental review. Until January 2, 2032, adjustments to reduce \nthe minimum lot width standard by up to 10 percent may be requested. Other than as \nspecified in this Subsection, adjustments are prohibited. \nE. Minimum front lot line. Each lot must have a front lot line that meets the minimum front \nlot line standard stated in Table 610-2. Lots that do not meet the minimum front lot line \nstandard may be requested through Planned Development Review or, when the site is in an \nenvironmental overlay zone, as a modification through environmental review. Until January \n2, 2032, adjustments to reduce the minimum front lot line standard by up to 10 percent \nmay be requested. Other than as specified in this Subsection, adjustments to this standard \nare prohibited. \nF. Minimum lot depth. Each lot must meet the minimum lot depth standard stated in Table \n610-2. Lots that do not meet the minimum lot depth standard may be requested through \nPlanned Development Review or, when the site is in an environmental overlay zone, as a \nmodification through environmental review. Until January 2, 2032, adjustments to reduce \nthe minimum lot depth standard by up to 10 percent may be requested. Other than as \nspecified in this Subsection, adjustments to this standard are prohibited. \nG. Regular lot lines. Proposed lot lines in the R10 through R2.5 zones must meet one of the \nfollowing regulations. Adjustments are prohibited. \n1. Standard. All lot lines must be straight and traverse in a single uniform direction \nexcept for lot lines that follow a zoning line, right of way, or boundary of a tract.\n \n2. Approval criterion. As far as is practical, all lot lines must be straight and traverse in a \nuniform direction taking into consideration topography and other natural features, \nexisting development, zoning, or other clearly identifiable boundary markers such as \nfences or hedgerows.  \n33.610.300 Through Lots \nA. Purpose. This standard ensures that lots are configured in a way that development can be \noriented toward streets to increase the safety and enjoyment of pedestrians and bicyclists. \nThe standard also ensures that development does not “turn its back” on a collector or \nmajor city traffic street.  \nB. Standard. Through lots are allowed only where both front lot lines are on local service \nstreets. The minimum front lot line and minimum width standards apply to one frontage of \nthe through lot. \n33.610.400 Flag Lots \nA. Purpose. These regulations allow the creation of flag lots in limited circumstances. The \nlimitations:  \n• Minimize the negative impacts of flag lots and additional driveways;  \n• Allow land to be divided when other options are not achievable; \n• Ensure that flag lots have adequate access from the street; and   Chapter 33.610 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nLots in RF Through R2.5 Zones 1/1/25 \n \n610-6 \n \n• Ensure that flag lots have access to utilities and services.  \nB. When a flag lot is allowed. A flag lot is allowed only when the following are met:  \n1. One of the following are met: \na. An existing dwelling unit or attached garage on the site is located so that it \nprecludes a land division that meets the minimum lot width standard of \nParagraph 33.610.200.D.1. The dwelling unit and attached garage must have \nbeen on the site for at least five years; or \nb. The site has dimensions that preclude a land division that meets the minimum lot \nwidth standard of Paragraph 33.610.200.D.1; \n2. Up to three lots are proposed, only one of which is a flag lot; and \n3. Minimum density requirements for the site will be met. \nC. Flag lot access pole. The pole portion of the flag lot must meet the following standards. \nExcept as allowed by Subparagraph C.2, adjustments are prohibited: \n1. The pole must connect to a street; \n2. The pole must be at least 12 feet wide for its entire length. Until January 2, 2032, \nadjustments to reduce the pole width by up to 10 percent may be requested; and \n3. The pole must be part of the flag lot and must be under the same ownership as the \nflag portion.  \nD. Lot area. Only the area of the flag portion is included when calculating the minimum and \nmaximum lot area. The area of the pole portion of the lot is not included. \nE. Minimum lot dimensions. \n1. Flag lots are exempt from the minimum front lot line standard. \n2. The minimum lot width and minimum lot depth required for each flag lot is 40 feet. \n3. For the purposes of this subsection width and depth are measured at the midpoints of \nthe opposite lot lines of the flag portion of the lot. All other lot dimension standards \nmust be met.  \nF. Vehicle access. Flag lot vehicle access must meet one of the following regulations: \n1. Vehicle access standard. Vehicle access must be shared between the flag lot and the \nlots between the flag portion of the lot and the street. Access easements may be used. \nAdjustments are prohibited. For proposals that cannot meet this standard, the \napproval criterion stated in Paragraph F.2. applies. \n2. Vehicle access approval criterion. Separate access may be allowed when the location \nof existing garages, driveways including driveways on abutting lots, alleys, curb cuts, \nstormwater management needs, or tree preservation make shared access impractical.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.610 \n1/1/25 Lots in RF Through R2.5 Zones \n \n610-7 \n33.610.500 Split Zoned Lots \nA. Purpose. This standard ensures that lots do not have more than one zone. Lots that are \nsplit by more than one zone present practical problems related to the applicability of use \nand development standards.  \nB. Standard. On sites with more than one base zone, each lot must be entirely within one \nzone. The creation of lots that are in more than one zone is not allowed. \n \n(Added by: Ord.

Single-dwelling development. Except in the IR zone, when a house, attached house, \nduplex, attached duplex, triplex, or fourplex is proposed for some or all of the site, the \napplicant must show how the proposed lots can meet the minimum density stated in \nChapter 33.120. Site area devoted to streets is subtracted from the total site area in order \nto calculate minimum density. \nB. All other development. When development other than a house, attached houses, duplex, \nattached duplex, triplex, or fourplex is proposed, minimum density must be met at the time \nof development. \n33.612.200 Lot Dimension Standards \nA. Purpose. These standards ensure that: \n• Each lot has enough room for development that meets all the requirements of the \nzoning code; \n• Lots are an appropriate size and shape so that development on each lot can be oriented \ntoward the street as much as possible.  \n• The multi-dwelling zones can be developed to full potential; and \n• Housing goals for the City are met. \nB.

The regulations of this chapter \nrequire that trees be considered early in the design process with the goal of preserving high value \ntrees and mitigating for the loss of trees. Desired benefits of trees include: \n• Protecting public health through the absorption of air pollutants, contamination, and \ncapturing carbon dioxide; \n• Buffering from noise, wind, and storms; \n• Providing visual screening and summer cooling; \n• Reducing energy demand and urban heat island impacts; \n• Filtering stormwater and reducing stormwater runoff; \n• Reducing erosion, siltation, and flooding; \n• Stabilizing slopes; \n• Enhancing property values; \n• Providing fish and wildlife habitat, including support for native species biodiversity through \nthe preservation and planting of native trees; \n• Providing food for people and wildlife; and \n• Contributing to the beauty of the City, its natural heritage, and the character of its \nneighborhoods.  \n33.630.020 Where These Regulations Apply \nA. Generally. The regulations of this chapter apply to all proposals for land divisions on sites \noutside the Central City plan district that have at least one tree that is at least 6 inches in \ndiameter, except where all trees on the site are exempt under 33.630.030. Where a tree \ntrunk is partially on the land division site, it is considered part of the site. \nB. Sites in C, E, I, and CI zones where all of the proposed lots are currently developed with \ncommercial, employment, industrial, or institutional development may defer tree \npreservation review to the time of any future development or redevelopment of the site. \nSites that use this option are subject to the standards of Title 11, Trees at the time of \ndevelopment. Sites in the IH, IG1, EX, and CX zones are not eligible to use this provision.  Chapter 33.630 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nTree Preservation 10/1/24 \n \n630-2 \n \nC. Proposals to divide sites that are partially within an Environmental, River Environmental, or \nPleasant Valley Natural Resources overlay zone and include a concurrent environmental \nreview, River Review, or Pleasant Valley Resource review are not subject to the tree \npreservation standards of Section 33.630.100. However, the tree preservation approval \ncriteria in 33.630.200 apply to these proposals. \n33.630.030 Exempt From These Regulations \nThe following trees are exempt from the regulations of this chapter: \nA. Trees that are on the Nuisance Plants List; \nB. Trees that are less than 6 inches in diameter; \nC. Trees that are dead, dying, or dangerous as determined by an arborist. The review body \nmay require additional analysis or documentation to confirm the condition of the tree; \nD. Trees where the trunk is within 10 feet of an existing building that will remain on the site; \nE. Trees where the trunk is located completely or partially within an existing right-of-way that \nis not part of the land division site; \nF. Trees where the trunk is located completely or partially within Environmental, River \nEnvironmental or Pleasant Valley Natural Resources Overlay zones. Those trees are instead \nsubject to the regulations of Chapter 33.430, Environmental Zones, 33.475.400, River \nEnvironmental Overlay Zone, or 33.465, Pleasant Valley Natural Resources Overlay Zones. \n33.630.100 Tree Preservation Standards \nA. At least one of the following tree preservation standards must be met. Adjustments to the \nstandards are prohibited. For proposals that cannot meet at least one standard, the \napproval criteria stated in 33.630.200 apply. Where a proposal can meet the standards, the \napplicant may choose to meet the approval criteria stated in 33.630.200 instead of the \nstandards. The total tree diameter on the site is the total diameter of all trees completely \nor partially on the site, minus the diameter of trees that are listed in Section 33.630.030, \nTrees exempt from these regulations.  \n1. Option 1: Preserve all of the trees that are 20 or more inches in diameter and at least \n30 percent of the total tree diameter on the site;  \n2. Option 2: Preserve at least 75 percent of the trees that are 20 or more inches in \ndiameter and at least 35 percent of the total tree diameter on the site; \n3. Option 3: Preserve at least 50 percent of the trees that are 20 or more inches in \ndiameter and at least 40 percent of the total tree diameter on the site; \n4. Option 4: Where all trees are less than 20 inches in diameter, preserve at least 45 \npercent of the total tree diameter on the site; or \n5. Option 5: If one or more tree groves are located on the site, preserve all of the grove \ntrees located on the site and at least 20 percent of the total tree diameter or canopy \narea on the site.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.630 \n10/1/24 Tree Preservation \n \n630-3 \nB. Heritage Trees. Heritage Trees located on the land division site may be counted toward \nmeeting preservation standards. Heritage Trees must be preserved unless removal has \nbeen approved by Portland Parks and Recreation. \nC. Location of preserved trees. Trees, other than grove trees, may be preserved on lots, \nwithin tree preservation tracts, or within other privately managed tracts, such as flood \nhazard, recreation area or stream, spring, seep, and wetlands tracts. Grove trees preserved \nto meet 33.630.100.A.5. must be preserved in tree preservation tracts or other privately \nmanaged tracts. Proposed tree preservation within tracts that are to be managed by the \nCity of Portland or a service district, must be approved by the City or service district. \n33.630.200 Tree Preservation Approval Criteria \nThe following tree preservation approval criteria apply to land divisions that cannot, or choose not \nto, meet 33.630.100, Tree Preservation Standards. Applicants must demonstrate how the proposed \ntree plan will meet the following tree preservation criteria. In meeting these criteria, applicants may \nuse options available in this and other chapters of this Title to modify development standards and \nminimum density in order to preserve trees. \nA. Tree preservation is maximized to the extent practicable while allowing for reasonable \ndevelopment of the site, considering the following:  \n1. The specific development proposed; \n2. The uses and intensity of development expected in the zone and the area in which the \nsite is located;  \n3. Requirements to provide services to the site under Chapters 33.651 through 33.654, \nincluding street connectivity and street plan requirements. Options to limit impacts on \ntrees while meeting these service requirements must be evaluated; \n4. Requirements to protect resources in Environmental, Pleasant Valley Natural \nResources, or Greenway Natural, Water Quality, and River Environmental overlay \nzones. Protection of environmental resources and retention of benefits from trees \nshould be maximized for the site as a whole; and  \n5. Other site constraints that may conflict with tree preservation, such as small or oddly \nshaped sites or trees located in existing utility easements. \nB. To the extent practicable, trees proposed for preservation provide the greatest benefits as \nidentified in the purpose of this chapter. In general, healthy, native or non-nuisance trees \nthat are 20 or more inches in diameter and tree groves, are the highest priority for \npreservation. However, specific characteristics of the trees, site and surrounding area \nshould be considered and may call for different priorities, such as native tree growth rates \nand priority tree sizes as described in the Portland Plant List, buffering natural resources, \npreventing erosion or slope destabilization and limiting impacts on adjacent sites; \nC. Trees proposed for preservation are suitable based on their health, overall condition and \npotential for long-term viability, considering the anticipated impact of development and \ntolerance typical for the tree species;  Chapter 33.630 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nTree Preservation 10/1/24 \n \n630-4 \n \nD. Mitigation. If the applicant’s tree preservation plan does not fully meet at least one \napplicable tree preservation standard stated in 33.630.100 or there is a concurrent \nenvironmental review, River Review or Pleasant Valley Resource review, mitigation must be \nprovided as needed to replace the functions of trees removed from the site. Options for \nmitigation may include preservation of smaller diameter or native trees, permanent \npreservation of trees within a tree preservation or environmental resource tract, tree \nplanting, payment into the City’s Tree Planting and Preservation Fund, or other options that \nare consistent with the purpose of this chapter. \n33.630.400 Modifications That Will Better Meet Tree Preservation Requirements \nA. Site-related development standards. The review body may consider modifications to site-\nrelated development standards as part of the land division review. These modifications are \ndone as part of the land division process and do not require an adjustment. Adjustments to \nuse-related development standards are subject to the adjustment process of Chapter \n33.805, Adjustments. Modification to a regulation that contains the word “prohibited,” or a \nregulation that is a qualifying situation or threshold is prohibited.  \n In order to approve the modification, the review body must find that the modification will \nresult in improved tree preservation, considering the tree preservation priorities for the \nsite, and will, on balance, be consistent with the purpose of the regulation being modified.  \nB. Minimum Density.  \n1. In multi-dwelling zones, minimum density may be reduced to preserve trees as stated \nin Paragraph 33.120.213.B.3. This provision may be used to reduce minimum density \nduring the land division process. Sites that reduce minimum density at the time of the \nland division are not eligible to further reduce minimum density at the time of \ndevelopment on the lots.  \n2. A reduction in minimum density in single-dwelling zones may be approved as part of \nthe land division review. The reduction is done as part of the land division review and \ndoes not require an adjustment. \na. Minimum density may be reduced by 20 percent or one lot, whichever is more, \nup to a maximum reduction of 4 lots. Reductions greater than those listed in this \nparagraph are prohibited.  \nb. The review body will approve the reduction in minimum density if the following \nare met: \n(1) The reduction in minimum density will result in improved tree preservation, \nconsidering the tree preservation priorities for the site; and \n(2) The lot or lots where trees are proposed to be preserved are not large \nenough to be further divided under the current zoning. Trees proposed for \npreservation may be placed in a tree preservation tract to reduce lot sizes \nand provide better protection for the trees to be preserved. \n33.630.500 Tree Preservation Credit  \nTrees that are preserved in a tree preservation tract that is outside of an Environmental, River \nEnvironmental, or Pleasant Valley Natural Resources overlay zone may count toward meeting the  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.630 \n10/1/24 Tree Preservation \n \n630-5 \ntree density standards for individual lots in Chapter 11.50, Trees in Development Situations. If this \noption is chosen, at least one tree must be planted or preserved on each lot. The preliminary plan \nmust indicate the lots where the credit from the preserved trees will be used. \n33.630.600 Recording Tree Preservation Plans and Related Conditions \nTree preservation plans approved as part of the preliminary plan and related conditions of approval \nmust be recorded with the County Recorder. The documents must be approved by PP&D prior  \nto recording.  \n \n(Added by: Ord. Nos. 175965 and 176333, effective 7/1/02. Amended by: Ord. No. 178657, effective \n9/3/04; Ord.

The standards of this chapter recognize that on-site \nstormwater facilities may be land intensive and site specific, consequently affecting the \narrangement of lots and streets. These regulations ensure that the land division site has an \nadequate area and an appropriate location for stormwater facilities.  \n33.653.020 Stormwater Management Standards \nStormwater management facilities must meet the following standards. Adjustments are prohibited. \nA. The Bureau of Environmental Services has preliminarily approved the capacity, type, \nlocation, feasibility and land area required of the proposed stormwater management \nsystem and stormwater disposal facilities as well as any connection to off-site facilities. The \napproval is based on the Sewer and Drainage Facilities Design Manual and the Stormwater \nManagement Manual; \nB. Ownership and maintenance. \n1. Except as allowed by Paragraph B.2., a stormwater facility that serves more than one \nlot must be in a stormwater facility or private street tract. The tract must be either \nowned in common by all of the owners of the lots served by the facility, by a \nHomeowners’ Association, by a public agency, or by a non-profit organization. \n2. Exceptions. \na. A private stormwater facility may be in an easement if the location of the tract \nwould preclude compliance with the front lot line requirements of Chapters \n33.610 through 33.615; \nb. An existing private stormwater facility may be in an easement, if there is a \nrecorded maintenance agreement; \nc.

These regulations ensure that the right-of-way system will \nserve each lot in the land division. Where possible, the system will extend through the land division \nto reach adjacent sites. Constraints, such as steep slopes or environmental zones on or near the site \nmay influence the location or preclude connected rights-of-way. These regulations protect the \npublic health and safety by ensuring safe movement and access for emergency and  \nservice vehicles.  \n33.654.020 Where These Regulations Apply \nThe regulations of this chapter apply to all land divisions. \n33.654.110 Connectivity and Location of Rights-of-Way \nA. Purpose. The regulations of this section ensure provision of efficient access to as many lots\nas possible, and enhance direct movement by pedestrians, bicycles, and motor vehicles\nbetween destinations. Direct routes for bicycles and pedestrians from residential areas to\nneighborhood facilities, such as schools and parks, are particularly important to increase\nthe convenience of travelling by foot or bicycle. Direct routes for motor vehicles are\nimportant for reducing vehicle miles travelled and traffic congestion, which reduces air and\nwater pollution and carbon emissions. Connected streets provide for more efficient\nprovision of utility and emergency services, and also enable a more even dispersal o\nf\nt\nraffic. The specific location of rights-of-way is influenced by a variety of conditions,\nincluding existing development, streets and lot patterns, and environmental features.\nB. Where these regulations apply.\n1. The standards stated in Subsection C. apply to proposals for land divisions in OS, R, C,\nE, CI, and IR zones. Adjustments are prohibited. For proposals that cannot meet all of\nt\nhe standards, the approval criteria stated in Subsection D. apply. Where a proposal\nc\nan meet the standards, the applicant may choose to meet all of the approval criteria\ns\ntated in Subsection D. instead of all of the standards.\n2. The approval criteria in Subsection D. apply to proposals for land divisions in I zones. Chapter 33.654 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRights-of-Way 10/1/24 \n \n654-2 \n \nC. Standards. \n1.  Through streets. \na.  Through streets must be provided where there is more than 530 feet between \nthrough streets unless the entire site frontage is within 200 feet of the closest \nintersecting edge of a through street. \nb.  Measuring the distance between through streets. \n(1) For the purposes of this standard, the distance between through streets is \nmeasured from the closest intersecting edge of the through street, partial \nthrough street, or self-contained pedestrian connection right of way in one \ndirection along the shared block frontage, to the closest intersecting edge of \nthe through street partial through street, or self-contained pedestrian \nconnection right of way in the opposite direction along the shared block \nfrontage.  \n(2) Dead end streets are not included in measurements between through \nstreets or pedestrian connections. \n2. Partial streets and partial pedestrian connections.  \na. Where the block includes a partial through street and where a straight-line \nextension of the partial through street would bring the street onto the site, a \npartial through street is required;  \nb. Where the block includes a partial pedestrian connection and where a straight-\nline extension of the partial pedestrian connection would bring the connection \nonto the site, a partial pedestrian connection is required; and \nc. Widening a partial street is required where a street that is not improved to its full \ndesign width borders the edge of the land division site.  \n3. Location. \na. Through streets. When a new through streets or an extension of a partial \nthrough street is required, the street must: \n(1)  Connect two or more streets when the site is abutting more than one \nthrough street or partial through street; \n(2) Be in alignment with partial through streets within the same block as the \nland division site; and \n(3) Extend to the boundary of the site to provide future access to adjacent sites, \neither by terminating at a dividable lot or locating along the edge of the land \ndivision site.  \nb. Pedestrian Connections. When a partial pedestrian connection is required by 2.b, \nthe pedestrian connection must: \n(1)  Complete the connection between two or more streets when the existing \npedestrian connection abuts the site; and  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.654 \n10/1/24 Rights-of-Way \n \n654-3 \n(2) Be in alignment with partial pedestrian connections within the same block \nas the land division site. \n4. Dead-end streets.  \na. Dead-end streets may be provided where through streets are not required. \nPublic dead-end streets may not exceed 200 feet in length or abut more than 8 \nlots within the land division site and must be at least 200 feet from any other \npublic dead-end street.   \nb. Where the land division site is adjacent to sites that may be divided under \ncurrent zoning, dead-end streets and pedestrian connections must be extended \nto the boundary of the site to provide future access to the adjacent sites. For the \npurposes of this standard, “may be divided” does not include middle housing \nland divisions.  \n5. Alleys. Alleys may be provided in addition to required streets to \naccommodate alternative vehicular access to proposed lots.\n \nD. Approval criteria.  \n1. Through streets and pedestrian connections in OS, R, C, E, CI, and IR Zones. In OS, R, C, \nE, CI, and IR zones, through streets and pedestrian connections are required where \nappropriate and practicable, taking the following into consideration:  \na. Through streets should generally be provided no more than 530 feet apart, and \npedestrian connections should generally be provided no more than 330 feet \napart. Through street and pedestrian connections should generally be at least \n200 feet apart; \nb. Where the street pattern in the area immediately surrounding the site meets the \nspacing of subparagraph a., above, the existing street pattern should be \nextended onto the site; \nc. Characteristics of the site, adjacent sites, and vicinity, such as:  \n(1) Terrain; \n(2) Whether adjacent sites may be further divided;  \n(3) The location of existing streets and pedestrian connections; \n(4) Whether narrow frontages will constrain creation of a through street or \npedestrian connection; \n(5) Whether any of the following interrupt the expected path of a through \nstreet or pedestrian connection: \n• Environmental, River Environmental, Pleasant Valley Natural Resource, \nor Greenway overlay zones; \n• Tree groves; \n• Streams; \n• Combined flood hazard area; or \n• Wetlands; and  Chapter 33.654 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRights-of-Way 10/1/24 \n \n654-4 \n \n(6) Whether existing dwelling units on- or off-site obstruct the expected path of \na through street or pedestrian connection. Alternative locations or designs \nof rights-of-way should be considered that avoid existing dwelling units. \nHowever, provision of through streets or pedestrian connections should \ntake precedence over protection of existing dwelling units where the \nsurrounding transportation system will be significantly affected if a new \nthrough street or pedestrian connection is not created; \nd. Master street plans for the area identified in the Transportation Element of the  \nComprehensive Plan; \ne. Pedestrian connections should take the most direct route practicable. Users \nshould be able to see the ending of the connection from the entrance point,  \nif possible. \n2. Dead-end streets in OS, R, C, E, CI, and IR zones.  \na. In OS, R, C, E, CI, and IR zones, dead-end streets may be provided where through \nstreets are not required. Dead-end streets should generally not exceed 200 feet \nin length, and should generally not serve more than 25 dwelling units. Public \ndead-end streets should generally be at least 200 feet apart. \nb. Where the land division site is adjacent to sites that may be divided under \ncurrent zoning, dead-end streets and pedestrian connections must be extended \nto the boundary of the site as needed to provide future access to the adjacent \nsites. Options for access and street locations must consider the characteristics of \nadjacent sites, including terrain, the location of existing dwellings, environmental \nor Pleasant Valley Natural Resource overlay zoning, streams, wetlands, special \nflood hazard areas, and tree groves. The following factors are considered when \ndetermining if there is a need to make provisions for future access to adjacent \nsites. A need may exist if: \n(1) The site is within a block that does not comply with the spacing standards or \nadopted street plan of the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive \nPlan; or \n(2) The full development potential of adjacent sites within the block will not be \nrealized unless a more complete street system is provided to improve \naccess to those sites. \n3. Pedestrian connections in I Zones. In I zones, pedestrian connections to all Regional \nTransitways, Major Transit Priority Streets, Transit Access Streets, Community Transit \nStreets, Off-Street Paths, and recreational trails within 1,300 feet of the site are \nrequired where appropriate and practicable. The connections should take the most \ndirect route practicable. Users should be able to see the ending of the connection \nfrom the entrance point, if possible. Only the portion of the pedestrian connection \nthat is on the land division site is required. \n4. Alleys in all zones. Alleys may be required where the provision of an alley is \nappropriate to mitigate transportation or development impacts. Alleys may be \nappropriate to move garage access away from busy streets, reduce the number of  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.654 \n10/1/24 Rights-of-Way \n \n654-5 \ndriveways crossing sidewalks, provide alternative locations on the site for parking, \nlimit the number of garage doors facing the street, and maintain on-street parking. \nWhere alleys are not required, applicants may choose to provide them. \n33.654.120 Design of Rights-of-Way \nA. Purpose. The purpose of these standards and approval criteria is to ensure that the vehicle, \nbicycle, and pedestrian circulation system is designed to be safe, efficient,  \nand convenient. \nB. Public streets. For public streets and public alleys, the Bureau of Transportation has \npreliminarily approved the right-of-way width and the design and configuration of \nelements within the right-of-way including frontage improvements.  \nC. Private streets. The following regulations apply to the design of private streets and private \nalleys. Portland Permitting & Development is authorized to develop and maintain \nadministrative rules for the width and the design and configuration of elements within a \nprivate street:  \n1. Width of the right-of-way. Private rights-of-way must meet the width standard stated \nin Subparagraph C.1.a. If the proposal cannot meet the standard, the applicant can \nchoose to meet the approval criterion in Subparagraph C.1.b. Adjustments are \nprohibited:  \na. Standard. The proposed private right-of-way must meet the applicable minimum \nwidth standards stated in the Permanent Administrative Rules for Private Rights \nof Way. Wider private rights of way may be proposed.  \nb. Approval criterion. The width of the local street right-of-way must be sufficient to \naccommodate expected users, taking into consideration the characteristics of the \nsite and vicinity, such as the existing street and pedestrian system \nimprovements, existing structures, natural features, the length of the street, and \nthe number of housing units served by the street. \n2. Configuration of elements. For all private rights-of-way, Portland Permitting & \nDevelopment has preliminarily approved the design and configuration of elements \nwithin the right-of-way in conformance with relevant administrative rules and the \nstandards in Paragraph C.3. \n3. Additional design standards for private rights-of-way:  \na. Turnarounds. \n(1) Purpose. A turnaround is a type of junction that allows traffic traveling in \none direction on a road to safely and efficiently reverse course and travel \nthe opposite direction without the need to back up long distances. \n(2) Standard. A turnaround is required on a dead-end street in the following \nsituations. Turnarounds are not required on a common green: \n• The street will serve 4 or more lots; \n• When required by the City Engineer to ensure forward egress onto a \nnon-local street;  Chapter 33.654 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRights-of-Way 10/1/24 \n \n654-6 \n \n• When the street is at least 300 feet long;   \n• When the street is longer than 150 feet and the street is needed to \nmeet the Fire Bureau requirements for fire emergency access; or \n• When the street is longer than 100 feet and the lots will each have \ncurbside garbage and recycling service.  \nb. Streets. \n(1)  Purpose. A private street provides access to new lots in a land division site, \nwhere public street access is not possible or practical. A private street \nprovides access for a limited number of motor vehicles, bicycles, and \npedestrians, and often provides a route for private and public utility \nconnections. In some circumstances a private street must also \naccommodate larger vehicles, such as fire trucks, delivery trucks, or \ngarbage/recycling trucks. By preventing through traffic and limiting the \nnumber of lots that are served, private streets have fewer users, reducing \nthe impacts on maintenance and allowing for reduced right of way widths.  \n(2) Standards for streets other than shared courts, common greens, or \npedestrian connections: \n• A private street must be a dead-end street;  \n• Up to 8 lots within the land division site may abut a private street;  \n• The Fire Bureau has approved the land division for emergency access;  \n• Except as allowed by C.3.b(3), in residential zones, one on-street parking \nspace is required for every two lots proposed. \n(3) On street parking exceptions. There are two exceptions to the requirement \nfor on-street parking in C.3.b(2). One is a standard and one is an approval \ncriterion: \n• Standard exception. On-street parking is not required when  \n- The street is less than 300 feet in length;  \n- No more than 3 lots within the land division site have a front lot line \non the street; and  \n- The lots with a front lot line on the street are developed with no \nmore than two dwelling units each. \n• Approval criterion. On-street parking may be reduced or waived when a \nsite-specific parking analysis is provided demonstrating that adequate \nparking will be available. The analysis must include information \nregarding expected on-street parking demand on the private street \nbased on allowed densities, access to alternative modes of travel, \navailability of parking in the area, feasibility of providing parking on the \nlots, and how visitors and deliveries will be accommodated.  \nc. Shared courts. \n(1)  Purpose. Shared courts provide shared vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle \naccess to abutting property. The access for all modes is accommodated on \nthe same surface and not differentiated by grade separation. A shared court \nmay function as a community yard. A shared court includes traffic calming \nmeasures to ensure safe co-existence of vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.654 \n10/1/24 Rights-of-Way \n \n654-7 \nin the same space. Shared courts should be designed to prioritize use of the \nright-of-way by pedestrians. Hard and soft landscape features may be \nincluded in a shared court, such as trees, shrubs, patterned brick paving, or \nbenches.  \n(2) Standards: \n• A shared court must not exceed 150 feet in length; \n• A shared court must be a dead-end street; \n• The Fire Bureau has approved the land division for emergency access; \n• Shared courts must include at least 250 square feet of grassy area, play \narea, or dedicated gardening space, exclusive of vehicle parking areas. \nThis area must be at least 15 feet wide at its narrowest dimension; and \n• Up to 16 lots within the land division site may abut a shared court. \nd. Common greens. \n(1)  Purpose. Common greens are landscaped rights of way that provide access \nfor pedestrians and bicycles to abutting property. Since no motor vehicle \naccess is provided, common greens are not limited in length or by the \nnumber of lots that can be served. Common greens are also intended to \nserve as a common open space amenity for residents, but not intended to \nserve as general pedestrian connections between streets.  \n(2) Standards: \n• The length of a common green and number of lots is not limited; \n• Common greens must be dead end streets. Through common greens \nare not allowed but common greens may be located on a corner of two \nintersecting streets. See Figure 654-1; \n• The Fire Bureau has approved the land division for emergency access; \n• Common Greens must include at least 400 square feet of grassy area, \nplay area, or dedicated gardening space, which must be at least 15 feet \nwide at its narrowest dimension; and \n• Vehicle area, except for emergency vehicle access approved by the Fire \nBureau, is prohibited in common greens;  Chapter 33.654 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRights-of-Way 10/1/24 \n \n654-8 \n \nFigure 654-1 \nCorner Common Green \n \ne. Pedestrian connections. \n(1)  Purpose. Pedestrian connections provide general access for pedestrians and \nbicyclists and provide a through connection between two streets or \nbetween a street and amenity like an open space tract. Private pedestrian \nconnections typically connect two private streets or tracts, but may connect \na private street to a public street.  \n(2) Standards: \n• The length of a private pedestrian connection is not limited; \n• Private pedestrian connections must only connect two private streets, a \nprivate street and a private tract, or a private street and a public street; \n• The Fire Bureau has approved the land division for emergency access; \n• Users must be able to see from one end of the connection to the other \nend; and \n• Vehicle area, except for emergency vehicle access approved by the Fire \nBureau, is prohibited in private pedestrian connections. \nf. Alleys. \n(1)  Purpose. Private alleys provide a secondary means of access, primarily \nintended for limited motor vehicle or service vehicles, though pedestrians \nand bicycles may still share the roadway in private alleys. Private alleys \nallow access to on-site parking to be consolidated, preserving the street \nfrontage for more continuous sidewalk improvements and also can be used \nto reduce traffic conflicts. \n(2) Standards: \n• Dead end private alleys may be up to 150 feet in length;  \n• The Fire Bureau has approved the land division for emergency access; \nand \n• Up to 8 lots can have a lot line abutting a dead end alley. There is no \nlimitation on the number of lots with a lot line on a through alley.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.654 \n10/1/24 Rights-of-Way \n \n654-9 \n33.654.130 Additional Standards for Rights-of-Way \nA. Street trees.  \n1. For existing and proposed public streets, the City Forester, in consultation with the \nCity Engineer, has preliminarily approved the street tree preservation, protection, and \nplanting plan.   \n2. Private street trees. Private street tree plans must meet the standard stated in \nSubparagraph A.2.a. If the proposal cannot meet the standard, the applicant can \nchoose to meet the approval criterion in Subparagraph A.2.b. Adjustments are \nprohibited:  \na. Private street tree standard. The street tree planting plan meets the Trees and \nLandscaping standards stated in the Permanent Administrative Rules for Private \nRights of Way;  \nb. Private street tree approval criteria. The number of private street trees may be \nreduced or are not required when: \n(1) It is not feasible to provide street trees while meeting 33.654.120 Design of \nRights Of Way, and the minimum lot size and dimension standards of the \nzone; \n(2) Trees will be planted in the front yard of each lot, near the street tract, \ngenerally one tree every 25 feet of frontage;  \n(3)  The proposed tree locations will not conflict with public utility easements on \nthe lots; and \n(4) Tree planting may be deferred until development of the lots, however, such \nplanting must occur prior to final building inspection. \nB. Utilities. Telephone, cable, natural gas, electric, and telecommunication utilities must be \nlocated within rights-of-way or utility easements that are adjacent to rights-of-way. Utility \neasements up to 15 feet in width may be required adjacent to rights-of-way. Utility \neasements needed to serve the lots must be identified during the preliminary land division \nplan review. \n33.654.150 Ownership, Maintenance, and Public Use of Rights-Of-Way \nA. Purpose. To protect long-term access and both public and private investment in the street \nsystem, the rights and responsibilities for the street system must be clear. Public ownership \nof streets is preferred to provide long-term access to sites and meet connectivity goals. \nHowever, where a dead-end street serves a limited number of units, the public benefit may \nbe very limited and the maintenance costs may be relatively high. In that limited situation, \nprivate streets may be appropriate. Where public ownership is not feasible, property \nowners must know their maintenance responsibilities and what public use to expect on \nrights-of-way. \nB. Ownership. Ownership of rights-of-way is determined through the following standards: \n1. Through streets. Through streets must be dedicated to the public.   Chapter 33.654 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRights-of-Way 10/1/24 \n \n654-10 \n \n2. Pedestrian connections. \na. Pedestrian connections that connect or are intended to eventually connect two \npublic streets must be dedicated to the public. \nb. Partial pedestrian connections that begin at a public right of way and terminate \nat the boundary of the land division site must be dedicated to the public.  \nc. Pedestrian connections that connect or are intended to eventually connect to a \npublic school, park or library must be dedicated to the public. \nd. Pedestrian connections that connect two private streets, or that connect a \nprivate street to a public street, may be privately owned unless B.2.c applies.  \ne. Pedestrian connections that are not dedicated to the public must be privately \nowned in common by the owners of the property within the land division site \nthat abut the pedestrian connection, or by the Homeowners’ Association. If the \npedestrian connection will not be dedicated to the public, it must be in a tract.\n \n3. Partial streets. Partial streets must be dedicated to the public. \n4. Dead-end streets.  \na. Dead-end streets and turnarounds must be dedicated to the public. Temporary \nturnarounds may be in an easement. \nb. Exception. A dead-end street and turnaround may be privately owned if the \nstreet is not a temporary dead-end street and meets the private street design \nrequirements in 33.654.120.C. The private street and turnaround must be in a \ntract, and owned in common by the owners of property served by the street or \nby the Homeowners’ Association. \n5. Alleys.  \na. Alleys that provide access to more than 5 lots within the land division site and \nabut sites that may be divided under current zoning must be dedicated to the \npublic unless the Bureau of Transportation does not agree to accept the \ndedication. \nb.

A Property Line Adjustment that configures either property as a flag lot, unless: \n1. The property was already a flag lot; or \n2. Both properties are in the R5 or R2.5 zone and: \na. There is an existing house on one or both properties;  \nb. Only one flag lot is proposed; \nB. A Property Line Adjustment that results in the creation of a buildable property from an \nunbuildable lot, lot of record, or lot remnant; \nC. A Property Line Adjustment that results in the creation of street frontage for property that \ncurrently does not have frontage on a street;   Chapter 33.677 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nProperty Line Adjustment 1/1/25 \n \n677-2 \n \nD. A Property Line Adjustment that removes alley frontage from one or both properties \nunless: \n1. The property line adjustment site includes a corner lot and alley frontage will only be \nremoved for one lot; or \n2. Alley frontage will only be removed from the lot in front of a flag lot that is being \ncreated through the Property Line Adjustment; and \nE. A Property Line Adjustment that creates a nonconforming use. \n33.677.150 Method of Review \nProperty Line Adjustments are reviewed through a non-discretionary, administrative procedure.

A request for a Property Line Adjustment will be approved if all of the \nfollowing are met: \nA. Conformance with regulations. Both properties will remain in conformance with \nregulations of this Title, including those in Chapters 33.605 through 33.615, except as \nfollows: \n1. If a property or development is already out of conformance with a regulation in this \nTitle, the Property Line Adjustment will not cause the property or development to \nmove further out of conformance with the regulation \n2. If the Property Line Adjustment will configure one of the properties as a flag lot, \nnonconformance with the maximum floor area ratio standard is allowed for the \nexisting development at the time of the property line adjustment. Future alterations \nmay not move the development further out of conformance and new development \nmust comply with the maximum floor area ratio; \n3. If both properties are already out of conformance with maximum lot area standards, \nthey are exempt from the maximum lot area standard;  \n4. If one property is already out of conformance with maximum lot area standards, then \none lot is exempt from the maximum lot area standard; \n5. Lots with an institutional use are exempt from maximum lot size standards;  \n6. If both properties are already less than 20,000 square feet in total area and the site is \nin an EG1 or EG2 zone, then at least one lot must comply with Standard B stated in \nTable 614 1;   \n7. If both properties are already less than 40,000 square feet in total area and the site is \nin an industrial zone, then at least one lot must comply with Standard B in  \nTable 615-1; and \n8. If at least one lot is already out of conformance with the minimum lot area standards \nand the site is in the R5 zone, the minimum lot area is 1600 square feet and the \nminimum width is 36 feet, if: \na. At least one lot is a corner lot; and \n  Chapter 33.677 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nProperty Line Adjustment 1/1/25 \n \n677-4 \n \nb. The adjusted property line must be perpendicular to the street lot line for its \nentire length.  \nSee Figure 677-1. \nB. Regular lot lines. In the R10 through RM4, and RMP zones, the adjusted property line must \nbe a straight line or up to 20 percent shorter or 20 percent longer than the existing lot line. \nLines that are adjusted to follow an established zoning line or the boundary of the \ncombined flood hazard area or floodway are exempt from this requirement. In addition, if \nboth properties are part of a site with an institutional use on it, this standard does not \napply.

A covenant must be recorded with the deed specifying that no \nvehicle access is allowed along the pole.  \n2. Lot dimensions. The lots must meet the following lot dimension standards: \na. Lot area.  \n(1) Minimum lot area. Each reconfigured lot must be at least 1,600 square feet. \nOnly the area of the flag portion is included when calculating the minimum \nlot area for the flag lot. The area of the pole portion of the lot is not \nincluded. \n(2) Maximum flag lot area. The area of the flag lot must be less than 3,000 \nsquare feet. The total area of the flag lot, including the pole portion, is \nincluded when calculating the maximum lot area for the flag lot.  \nb. Front lot line. There is no minimum front lot line standard for the flag lot. \nc.  Lot width and depth. The minimum lot width and minimum lot depth required \nfor the flag lot is 36 feet measured at the midpoints of the opposite lot lines of \nthe flag portion of the lot.

In addition, other land use reviews may also be required, depending upon the \nlocation, the use proposed, the site development proposed, or materials to be used on  \nthe site. \n33.700.010 Uses and Development Which Are Allowed By Right \nProposals for uses or developments which are allowed by right under this Title are subject to the \nfollowing regulations. For the purposes of this chapter, uses and development allowed by right \nincludes any limited uses which are not subject to a land use review.  \nA. Method of review. Requests for uses and development which are allowed by right are \nreviewed for compliance with the zoning regulations. The review is a nondiscretionary \nadministrative review. Decisions are made by the Director of PP&D and are final. The \nreview is done in a timely manner according to general operating procedures of Portland \nPermitting & Development and the City.  \n \n \n  Chapter 33.700 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nAdministration and Enforcement 1/1/25 \n700-2 \nB. Applications.  \n1. Applications for nondiscretionary reviews are generally processed in conjunction with \nobtaining a building permit or a home occupation permit. Applicants must submit \ninformation showing that the proposal complies with this Title, including a site plan \nwith the necessary level of detail. \n2. The applicant has the responsibility to obtain the property owner's permission for  \nthe request. \n3. Approvals of nondiscretionary reviews are based on the information submitted. If the \ninformation is incorrect, the approval may be voided.  \nC. Applications which will not be accepted. \n1. Prohibited uses and development. Applications for uses or development which are \nlisted as prohibited in this Title will not be accepted. \n2. Reasonable use. The Director of PP&D or a review body may refuse an application \nwhen the proposed structure has been clearly designed for a use or development \ndifferent from that which is being proposed, and could not reasonably be expected to \nmeet the needs of the proposed use or development. An example would be an \napplication for the construction of a house, when the building has no kitchen or \nbathrooms. \n3. Procedure. When an application is not accepted, the applicant may appeal the \ndecision through the Type II procedure. The applicant's appeal will be considered an \nappeal of an administrative decision, and will be subject to all notice, hearing, and fee \nrequirements for a Type II procedure. A letter requesting the appeal, showing how the \napplication complies with the requirements of Title 33, and stating the reasons the \nappeal should be granted will substitute for an official appeal form. \n33.700.015 Review of Land Divisions \nProposals for land divisions and final plats that are subject to discretionary review under this Title \nrequire a land use review. The specific land use review is stated in the 600s series of chapters. Each \nland use review has specified procedures. See Chapter 33.730 for a description of the quasi-judicial \nprocedures.  \nA. Adjustment review required for existing development \n1. Conforming development. If a proposed land division will cause conforming \ndevelopment to move out of conformance with any regulation of the zoning code, and \nif the regulation may be adjusted, the land division request must include a request for \nan adjustment. If an adjustment to the regulation is prohibited, the land division is \nprohibited.  \n2. Nonconforming development. If a proposed land division will cause nonconforming \ndevelopment to move further out of conformance with any regulation of the zoning \ncode, and if the regulation may be adjusted, the land division request must include a \nrequest for an adjustment. If an adjustment to the regulation is prohibited, the land \ndivision is prohibited.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.700 \n1/1/25 Administration and Enforcement \n \n700-3 \nB. Applications that will not be accepted. Applications for land divisions that include \nelements that are prohibited by this Title will not be accepted.  \n33.700.020 Uses and Development Which Are Not Allowed By Right  \nRequests for uses and development which are not allowed by right require a land use review. The \nspecific land use review is stated in the base zone or other regulations of this Title. Each land use \nreview has specified quasi-judicial procedures. See the 800s series of chapters for a description of \nthe land use reviews and Chapter 33.730 for a description of the quasi-judicial procedures. \n33.700.030 Violations and Enforcement \nA. Violations. It is unlawful to violate any provisions of this Title, a land use decision, or \nconditions of a land use approval. This applies to any person undertaking a development or \nland division, to the proprietor of a use or development, or to the owner of the land \nunderlying the development or land division. For the ease of reference in this chapter, all of \nthese persons are referred to by the term \"operator.\" \nB. Notice of violations. PP&D must give written notice of any violation of this Title, land use \ndecision, or conditions of land use approval to the operator. Failure of the operator to \nreceive the notice of the violation does not invalidate any enforcement actions taken by \nthe City. \nC. Responsibility for enforcement. The regulations of this Title, land use decisions, and \nconditions of land use approvals may be enforced in one or more of the following ways: \n1. By the Director of PP&D pursuant to Chapter 3.30 and Title 22 of the City Code; or \n2. By the Director of PP&D pursuant to 33.700.040 below. \n33.700.040 Reconsideration of Land Use Approvals \nA. Purpose. The ability to publicly reconsider a land use approval provides an opportunity to \ndetermine if the use or development is in compliance with this Title. It also allows for \nclarification of prior land use approvals. As part of this reconsideration, the ability to add \nnew conditions or even revoke the approval provides a strong enforcement mechanism for \nthis code. \nB. Situations when land use approvals may be reconsidered. All quasi-judicial land use \napprovals, except plan amendments, zone changes, and land divisions, may be \nreconsidered. In addition, all uses that became conditional uses or nonconforming uses due \nto a change of zoning regulations or mapping are also eligible for reconsideration. They \nmay be reconsidered if there is evidence of any of the following situations: \n1. One or more conditions of the land use approval have not been implemented or have \nbeen violated; \n2. The activities of the use, or the use itself, are substantially different or have \nsubstantially increased in intensity from what was approved. Examples of increases in \nintensity are: an increase in the number of members, students, employees, visitors, or \nvehicle trips per event, per year, or per other comparable period of time; an increase \nin the hours of operation; or an increase in the number of events per year; or   Chapter 33.700 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nAdministration and Enforcement 1/1/25 \n700-4 \n3. The use is subject to the conditional use or nonconforming use regulations, has not \nbeen subject to a conditional use or nonconforming use review, and has substantially \nchanged its activities or substantially increased the intensity of its operations since it \nbecame a conditional use or a nonconforming use. Examples of increases in intensity \nare: an increase in the number of members, students, employees, visitors, or vehicle \ntrips per event, per year, or per other comparable period of time; an increase in the \nhours of operation; or an increase in the number of events per year. \nC. Initiating the reconsideration. The Director of PP&D may initiate a reconsideration if there \nis substantial evidence that one of the situations described in Subsection B. above applies \nto the use or development. The evidence relied on must be made part of the record. The \nreconsideration may be initiated anytime after 60 days have passed from the first notice of \nviolation as described in 33.700.030.B. above. \nD. Procedure for reconsideration. \n1. Procedure. After initiation, the reconsideration is processed using a modified Type III \nprocedure. An application does not have to be submitted, a pre-application \nconference is not required, and a fee is not charged.  \n2. Review body. The review body is the same one that is assigned to hear new requests \nof that review type. \n3. Notice. \na. Notice to the operator. The operator will be notified that the reconsideration \nprocess has been initiated. This notice will be mailed at least 30 days prior to the \nscheduled hearing. Written comments from the operator must be received 15 \ndays prior to the public hearing date to be included in the staff report. \nb. Additional public notice. In addition to people who are mailed notice due to the \nType III procedure requirements, people who have complained in writing about \nthe use or development are also mailed notice of the hearing. \nE. Possible actions at the reconsideration hearing. Depending on the situation, the review \nbody may take any of the actions described below. The review body may not approve a \nnew use or one more intense than originally approved unless the possibility of this change \nhas been stated in the public notice. \n1. Uses or development which are alleged to have not fulfilled conditions or which \nviolate conditions are subject to the following actions. \na. The review body may find that the use or development is complying with the \nconditions of the land use approval. In this case, the use or development is \nallowed to continue. \nb. The review body may find that the use or development does not fully comply \nwith the conditions of approval, but that the violations are not substantial \nenough to warrant revocation, and that the use can comply with the original \napproval criteria if the conditions are met. In this case, the review body may \nmodify the existing conditions, add new conditions to ensure compliance with  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.700 \n1/1/25 Administration and Enforcement \n \n700-5 \nthe approval criteria, and refer the case to the Code Hearings Officer for \nenforcement of the existing conditions. \nc. The review body may revoke the land use approval if it finds that there are \nsubstantial violations of conditions or failure to implement conditions of prior \nland use decisions, such that the original approval criteria for the use or \ndevelopment are not being met. \n2. Uses and development which are alleged to be different from what was approved are \nsubject to the following actions. \na. The review body may find that the use or development is consistent with what \nwas approved. In this case, the use or development is allowed to continue. \nb. The review body may find that the use or development, including its intensity or \nscale, is not consistent with what was approved, but that the differences are not \nsubstantial enough to warrant revocation, and that the use or development can \ncomply with the original approval criteria with appropriate conditions. In this \ncase, the review body may modify the existing conditions or add new conditions \nto ensure compliance with the original approval criteria. \nc. The review body may revoke the land use approval if it finds that the land use \nbeing conducted on the site is substantially different from what was approved, \ndoes not comply with the original approval criteria for the use, and it cannot be \nreasonably conditioned to come into compliance. \n3. Conditional uses and nonconforming uses that have not been subject to a land use \nreview are subject to the following actions: \na. The review body may find that the use and its activities, including its intensity, \nare consistent with what was on the site at the time it became a conditional or \nnonconforming use. In this case, the use is allowed to continue. \nb. The review body may find that the use and its activities are substantially different \nor have substantially increased in intensity from what was on the site at the time \nit became a conditional use or nonconforming use. In this case, the review body \nmay apply conditions or restrictions to ensure that the changes in activities or \nsubstantial increases in intensity comply with the current approval criteria for the \nuse.  \nF. Enforcement of revocation. In the event that the land use approval is revoked, the use or \ndevelopment becomes illegal. The use or development must be terminated within 21 days \nof the date the revocation decision is filed with the City Auditor, unless the decision \nprovides otherwise. Enforcement is the responsibility of PP&D. \n33.700.050 Performance Guarantees \nA. Purpose. This section states the requirements for performance guarantees when they are \nrequired of an applicant by this Title or as a condition of a land use approval.  \nB. Types of guarantees. Guarantees by the applicant may be in the form of a performance \nbond payable to the City in cash, by certified check, time certificate of deposit, irrevocable  Chapter 33.700 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nAdministration and Enforcement 1/1/25 \n700-6 \nletter of credit, or other form acceptable to the City. Indemnity agreements may be used \nby other governmental agencies. Guarantees must be accompanied by a contract. The form \nof the guarantee and contract must be approved by the City Attorney. The Director of \nPP&D is authorized to accept and sign the contract for the City, and to accept the \nguarantee. The guarantee must be filed with the City Auditor. \nC. Amount of guarantee. The amount of the performance guarantee must be equal to at least \n110 percent of the estimated cost of performance. The applicant must provide written \nestimates by three contractors with their names and addresses. The estimates must include \nas separate items all materials, labor, and other costs of the required action. \nD. Completion. An inspection and approval of the action or improvement covered by the \nperformance guarantee is required before the performance guarantee is returned. The \ninspection is done by PP&D or other appropriate City bureaus. If the action or \nimprovement is not completed satisfactorily within the stated time limits, the City may \nhave the necessary action or improvement completed and seek reimbursement for the \nwork from the performance guarantee. Any remaining funds will be returned to the \napplicant. \n33.700.060 Covenants with the City \nA. Content of the covenant. A covenant required by this Title or a condition of a land use \napproval must state that: \n1. The owner will comply with all applicable code requirements and conditions of \napproval; and \n2. If the owner fails to perform under the covenant, the City may terminate occupancy of \nthe site and seek all necessary injunctive relief, including seeking to prevent future \noccupancy of the site while a violation of the covenant exists. \n3. Where the development rights of one site are dependent on the performance of \nconditions by the owner of another site (such as the transfer of development rights), \nthe covenants are judicially enforceable by the owner of one site against the owner of \nanother. \nB. Adopting the covenant. The form of all covenants must be approved by the City Attorney. \nThe covenant must run with the land. The covenant must be attached to the deed and be \nrecorded in the appropriate records of the county in which the site is located. Proof of the \nrecording must be made prior to the issuance of any building permits. \n33.700.070 General Rules for Application of the Code Language \nThe rules of this section apply to this Title and any conditions of a land use approval granted under \nthis Title. \nA. Reading and applying the code. Literal readings of the code language will be used. \nRegulations are no more or less strict than as stated. Applications of the regulations that \nare consistent with the rules of this section are nondiscretionary actions of the Director of \nPP&D to implement the code. The action of the Director of PP&D is final. \nB. Ambiguous or unclear language. Where the language is ambiguous or unclear, the Director \nof PP&D may issue a statement of clarification processed through a Type III procedure, or  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.700 \n1/1/25 Administration and Enforcement \n \n700-7 \ninitiate an amendment to Title 33 as stated in Chapter 33.835, Goal, Policy, and  \nRegulation Amendments. \nC. Situations where the code is silent. Proposals for uses, development, or land divisions \nwhere the Code is silent or where the rules of this section do not provide a basis for \nconcluding that the proposal is allowed are prohibited. The Planning and Sustainability \nDirector may initiate an amendment to Title 33 to add a new use category, or make other \namendments, as stated in Chapter 33.835, Goal, Policy, and Regulation Amendments. \nD. Terms. \n1. Defining words. Words used in the zoning code have their dictionary meaning unless \nthey are listed in Chapter 33.910, Definitions. Words listed in the Definitions chapter \nhave the specific meaning stated, unless the context clearly indicates  \nanother meaning. \n2. Tenses and usage.  \na. Words used in the singular include the plural. The reverse is also true.  \nb. Words used in the present tense include the future tense. The reverse is  \nalso true.  \nc. The words \"must,\" \"will,\" and \"may not\" are mandatory.  \nd. \"May\" is permissive.  \ne. \"Prohibited\" means that an adjustment, conditional use, or other land use review \nmay not be requested in order to allow an exception to the regulation in \nquestion. This does not preclude requests for zone changes or Comprehensive \nPlan map amendments. \nf. When used with numbers, “Up to x,” “Not more than x” and “a maximum of x” \nall include x.  \n3. Conjunctions. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the following \nconjunctions have the following meanings: \na. \"And\" indicates that all connected items or provisions apply; \nb. \"Or\" indicates that the connected items or provisions may apply singly or in \ncombination; \nc. \"Either...or\" indicates that the connected items or provisions apply singly, but not \nin combination. \n4.

The lists are intended to provide examples, but not \nto be exhaustive of all possibilities.  \n \n \n  Chapter 33.700 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nAdministration and Enforcement 1/1/25 \n700-8 \nE. Hierarchy of regulations. \n1. Different levels of regulations. In general, an area with base zoning, overlay zoning, or \nan area in a plan district is subject to all of the regulations of each. Where a land \ndivision is requested, the regulations of the 33.600s series of chapters also  \nmust be met. \n When the regulations conflict, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the following \nrules apply: \na. The regulations in a plan district supersede regulations in overlay zones, base \nzones, and regulations in the 600s series of chapters; \nb. The regulations in an overlay zone supersede regulations in base zones and \nregulations in the 600s series of chapters; \nc. The regulations for plan districts and overlay zones also supersede conflicting \nregulations for a specific use or development stated in the 200s series of \nchapters; and \nd. The regulations in the 200s series of chapters supersede regulations in the 600s \nseries of chapters. \n2. Regulations at the same level. When regulations at the same level conflict, those that \nare more specific to the situation apply. When the regulations are equally specific or \nwhen it is unclear which regulation to apply, the most restrictive applies. Regulations \nat the same level include such situations as two different standards in a base zone or \nregulations from separate chapters in the 200s series of chapters. \n3. Figures, tables, and maps. Where there are differences of meaning between code text \nand figures or tables, the code text controls. When there are differences between \ncode text and maps, the maps control. \nF. Sites in more than one zone. When a site is in more than one zone, the development \nstandards of each zone apply to the portion of the site in that zone. \nG. Applying the code to specific situations. Generally, where the code cannot list every \nsituation or be totally definitive, it provides guidance through the use of descriptions and \nexamples. In situations where the code provides this guidance, the descriptions and \nexamples are used to determine the applicable regulations for the situation. If the code \nregulations, descriptions, and examples do not provide adequate guidance to clearly \naddress a specific situation, the stated intent of the regulation and its relationship to other \nregulations and situations are considered. \nH. Determining whether a land use request is quasi-judicial or legislative. Quasi-judicial and \nlegislative are terms describing two different types of land use actions. In general, \nlegislative actions involve the adoption of law or policy applicable Citywide or to a broad \ngeographical area of the City. Quasi-judicial actions involve the application of existing law \nor policy to a small area or a specific factual situation. There are different legal \nrequirements for the processing of these two types of actions. In general, quasi-judicial \nactions require greater notice and procedural protections than do legislative actions. If \nthere are questions as to whether a specific request for a land use review is quasi-judicial  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.700 \n1/1/25 Administration and Enforcement \n \n700-9 \nor legislative, the decision will be made by the City Attorney. The decision will be based on \ncurrent law and legal precedent. Requests for decisions on this issue must be in writing and \nmust be filed with the Director of PP&D, who will forward the request to the City Attorney. \n33.700.075 Automatic Changes to Specified Dollar Thresholds \nThe sections listed below include dollar thresholds. These thresholds will be increased or decreased \neach year on March 1. The change will occur automatically, and the new dollar amount will be \nplaced in the Zoning Code without being subject to the procedures for amending the Zoning Code. \nThe change will be based on the annual national average of the Construction Cost Index (CCI), as \npublished in the second January issue of the Engineering News-Record. \nA. The following sections are subject to this regulation. Any increase or decrease that is not a \nmultiple of $50 will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50: \n1. 33.258.070.D.2.a; \n2. 33.258.070.D.2.d(2); \n3. 33.440.230.D.1; \n4. 33.475.200.E.1; \n5. 33.510.253.D.1.a; \n6. 33.515.278.B.17.a(1); \n7.  33.560.020 \n8. 33.565.310.B.2 \n9. Table 846-1; and  \n10. Table 846-3. \nB. The following sections are subject to this regulation. Any increase or decrease that is not a \nmultiple of $0.10 will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.10: \n1. 33.510.205.C.2.f.; and \n2. 33.510.210.D.2.b(6) \nTimeliness of Regulations \n33.700.080 Regulations That Apply at the Time of an Application \nThe regulations of this section apply to applications for land use reviews and building or \ndevelopment permits. \nA. Applications.  \n1. Application for land use review. Applications for land use reviews will be processed \nbased on the regulations in effect on the date an application is filed with the City, or \non a date requested by the applicant, as follows: \na. Application filing date.  Chapter 33.700 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nAdministration and Enforcement 1/1/25 \n700-10 \n(1) Complete at filing. If, on the date the application is filed with the City, the \napplication contains all the information stated in 33.730.060, Application \nRequirements, as well as any additional information required in the pre-\napplication conference notes, the application will be processed based on \nthe regulations in effect on the date the application is filed;  \n(2) Complete within 180 days. If, on the date the application is filed with the \nCity, the application does not contain all the information stated in Section \n33.730.060, Application Requirements, as well as any additional information \nrequired in the pre-application conference notes, but the applicant provides \nthe information within 180 days of the date the application was filed, the \napplication will be processed based on the regulations in effect on the date \nthe application  \nwas filed. \nb. Applicant requested date. For a land use review related to residential uses, the \napplicant may request, in writing, that the application for the land use review be \nprocessed based on the regulations in effect on the date of the request after the \napplication is filed with the City but before the public notice of the review has \nbeen sent by the City. When this occurs, the applicant will have 180 days from \nthe date of the written request to provide any additional information necessary \nto determine the application is complete. This request may be made only once \nfor each land use review application.   \n2. Application for building or development permit. Applications for building or \ndevelopment permits will be processed based on regulations in effect on the date a \ncomplete application is filed with the City. For the purposes of this section, a complete \nbuilding or development permit application contains the information necessary for \nPP&D to determine whether the proposal conforms with all applicable use regulations \nand development standards. \nB. Revisions to building or development permit applications. Revisions will be processed \nbased on the regulations in effect when the original complete application was received if: \n1. The use remains within the same use category as in the original application; \n2. The revision does not increase the total square footage of the proposed use; \n3. The original application has not expired; and \n4. The revised development meets all applicable development standards. \nC. Use of new regulations or mapping. Applications will not be accepted for building permits \nor land use reviews based on regulations or changes to zoning maps that have been \napproved but not yet implemented, or have been adopted but have not yet become \neffective. However, pre-application conferences may be requested and held.  \n33.700.090 Regulations That Apply After Approval \nThe regulations of this section apply to land use approvals that are subject to expiration as provided \nin 33.730.130, Expiration of an Approval.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.700 \n1/1/25 Administration and Enforcement \n \n700-11 \nA. Building permits. Applications for building permits for development approved by a land use \ndecision that has not expired are subject only to the regulations in effect on the date a land \nuse application was filed with the City, or on the date requested by the applicant, as \nspecified in 33.700.080.A.1. \nB. Land divisions. Applications for Final Plat approval where the Preliminary Plan approval has \nnot expired are subject only to the regulations in effect on the date an application for \nPreliminary Plan was filed with the City, as specified in 33.700.080.A.1. \n33.700.100 Transfer of Approval Rights \nApprovals of quasi-judicial land use reviews run with the land and are transferred with ownership. \nAny conditions, time limits, or restrictions apply to all subsequent operators. \n33.700.110 Prior Conditions of Land Use Approvals \nThis section addresses situations where a use, development, or land division was approved with \nconditions as part of a land use review under zoning or land division regulations that no longer apply \nto the site. Over time, there are instances when uses or development previously approved with \nconditions are subject to new zoning or land division regulations. This may result from a change of \nthe content of zoning or land division regulations or from legislative zone changes including \nannexation rezonings. \nA. Conditions of approval prior to 1981. Conditions of approval for a land use review applied \nfor prior to 1981 no longer apply to a site, except for conditions on all types of land \ndivisions, Planned Unit Developments (PUD), or any other quasi-judicial review approved in \nassociation with a land division or PUD. \nB. Conditions of approval after 1981. The regulations stated below apply to all prior \nconditions of approval for all types of land divisions, Planned Unit Developments (PUD), \nand any other quasi-judicial review approved in association with a land division or PUD, and \nfor land use reviews applied for after January 1, 1981, unless the conditions of approval or \nthe ordinance adopting the conditions provide for their continuance. \n1. Zone changes. If a site is subject to conditions as the result of a zone change, the \nconditions continue to apply if the site is rezoned to a comparable zone as part of an \nannexation rezoning or as part of a legislative remapping. The conditions of the \noriginal zone change do not apply if the site is rezoned to a noncomparable zone. \nComparable zone changes are single-dwelling to single-dwelling, multi-dwelling to \nmulti-dwelling, commercial to commercial or commercial/mixed use, employment to \nemployment, and industrial or manufacturing to industrial zones. Also, changes from a \nCity M3 or Multnomah County LM, M3, or M4 zone to a C, E, or I zone retain all \nconditions of approval on the site. Other zone changes are considered \nnoncomparable. \n2. Conditional uses. \na. An allowed conditional use. If a use was an approved conditional use under the \nprior regulations or had a Community Service overlay zone, and is a conditional \nuse under the new regulations pertaining to the site, any conditions of approval \ncontinue to apply.   Chapter 33.700 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nAdministration and Enforcement 1/1/25 \n700-12 \nb. Use allowed by right. If the use is now allowed by right, the conditions of \napproval no longer apply, except for the following: \n(1) Conditions of approval that mandate a Transportation Demand \nManagement plan or address parking, vehicle trips or any other \ntransportation system related issue on a site with a College or Medical \nCenter in a CI1 or CI2 zone continue to apply until superseded by an \napproved Transportation Impact review; \n(2) Conditions of approval continue to apply to outdoor sports facilities that are \non a site with a College or Medical Center that was an approved use under \nthe prior regulations. \nc. Use no longer allowed. If the use was a conditional use without an expiration \ndate and is no longer allowed, it becomes a nonconforming use under the new \nregulations, and must continue to meet the conditions as well as the \nnonconforming use regulations. If the use was a conditional use with an \nexpiration date and is no longer allowed, it is subject to the same regulations as \nrevocable permits, as stated in Paragraph 120.C.1 below. \n3. Variances and adjustments. If the variance or adjustment was for development that is \nnow allowed by right, and the development on the site conforms with the current \nregulations, then the prior conditions of approval no longer apply. \n4. Greenway review. If a use or development is subject to conditions under a greenway \nreview, the conditions continue to apply. \n5. Other land use actions. If the use or development was approved with conditions under \na review that is no longer in effect on the site (such as site review, design review, \nsignificant environmental concern review), the conditions no longer apply. \n33.700.115 Expiration of Tree Preservation Requirements \nThe regulations of this section apply to tree preservation required as a condition of a land use \nreview or required in a tree preservation plan approved in conjunction with a land use review for \nsites within the City Limits. These regulations do not apply outside the City Limits. Although tree \npreservation requirements may expire for a site, the site is still subject to the tree requirements of \nthis Title and Title 11, Trees.  \nA. Generally. Tree preservation requirements expire 10 years from the effective date of the \nland use approval, unless otherwise stated in the land use approval or as specified in  \nB and C; \nB. Land divisions. Tree preservation requirements for land divisions expire 10 years from the \ndate the final plat is approved, unless otherwise stated in the conditions of approval; and \nC. Master plans and IMPs.

Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.700 \n1/1/25 Administration and Enforcement \n \n700-13 \nA. Uses that are now allowed. Revocable permits for uses that are now an allowed use are \nrevoked and the uses are subject to the zoning regulations. Specific activities of the use \nwhich were allowed by the revocable permit but that do not conform to the code may \ncontinue and are limited by any conditions of approval from the prior revocable permit. \nAny other conditions of approval no longer apply. \nB. Uses that are now conditional uses. Revocable permits for uses that are now regulated as \na conditional use are revoked and the uses are subject to the conditional use regulations. \nAny conditions of approval continue to apply. Specific activities of the use that were \nallowed by the revocable permit but do not conform to the code may continue and are \nlimited by any conditions of approval from the prior revocable permit. \nC. Uses that are prohibited. Revocable permits for uses that are prohibited by this Title may \ncontinue under the conditions of the permit as provided below. \n1. Revocable permits with a specified expiration date.  \na. A revocable permit that has a specified expiration date continues to be in effect \nuntil the expiration date, the use that was approved changes, or the owner \nchanges. Transfers of permit rights or modifications to the permit are prohibited. \nThe holder of the revocable permit may ask to have a one-time extension of the \nexpiration date of up to 3 years. Approval of more than one extension is \nprohibited. Extensions are processed through a Type III procedure. An extension \nwill be granted if the review body finds that all of the following approval criteria \nare met:  \n(1) The use has no adverse impacts on surrounding uses; and  \n(2) The extension is necessary to allow the use time to cease operation or to \nmove to a location where the use is allowed. \nb. Exception. If the revocable permit granted additional residential dwelling units, \nthen the extra dwelling units become nonconforming residential density, and \nmust meet nonconforming residential density regulations. In this case, any \nconditions of approval of the revocable permit no longer apply. \n2. Revocable permits without an expiration date.  \na. A revocable permit that does not have a specified expiration date continues to \nbe in effect until the use that was approved changes or the owner changes. \nExtensions, transfers of permit rights, or modifications to the permit  \nare prohibited. \nb. Exceptions. \n(1). If the revocable permit granted additional residential dwelling units, then \nthe extra dwelling units become nonconforming residential density and \nmust meet nonconforming residential density regulations. In this case, any \nconditions of approval of the revocable permit no longer apply. \n(2) If the use established by the revocable permit has been maintained over \ntime, and the applicant can document that the use has been maintained  Chapter 33.700 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nAdministration and Enforcement 1/1/25 \n700-14 \nover time using standard evidence per 33.258.038.B or through a review per \n33.258.075, then the use becomes a nonconforming use and must meet \nnonconforming use regulations. If the use approved through the revocable \npermit has been discontinued for 3 consecutive years, it has not been \nmaintained over time. The use is considered to be discontinued when the \nuse approved ceases to operate, even if the structure or materials related to \nthe use remain. Conditions of approval of the revocable permit continue to \napply, except for any conditions that limit the transfer of ownership.  \n33.700.130 Legal Status of Lots \nA. A lot shown on a recorded plat remains a legal lot except as follows: \n1. The plat, or the individual lot or parcel lines have been vacated as provided by City \nCode; or \n2. The lot has been further divided, or consolidated, as specified in the 600 series of \nchapters in this Title, or as allowed by the former Title 34. \nB. Where a portion of the lot has been dedicated for public right-of-way, the remaining \nportion retains its legal status as a lot, unless it has been further altered as specified in \nSubsection A, above. \nC. The determination that a lot has legal status does not mean that the lot may be developed, \nunless all requirements of this Title are met. \n \n(Amended by: Ord. No. 163697, effective 1/1/91; Ord.

Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.705 \n3/1/24 Neighborhood Contact \n \n705-1 \n \nChapter 33.705 Neighborhood Contact \n705 \n \nSections: \n33.705.010 Purpose  \n33.705.020 Neighborhood Contact Steps \n \n33.705.010 Purpose  \nThe neighborhood contact process provides an opportunity for people who live, work or otherwise pass \nby a development site to learn about a project before construction begins. It makes the same \ninformation accessible online to interested community members. The neighborhood contact steps \nprovide an opportunity for members of the community to provide feedback to the property owner or \ndeveloper on the design and other aspects of the development. In most cases, the neighborhood \ncontact steps involve a sign posted on the site, but in some larger development scenarios, the property \nowner or developer will be required to host a public meeting. While the neighborhood contact outreach \nsteps are required prior to submitting for a land use review or building permit, any feedback provided to \nthe property owner or developer is informal and non-binding. By engaging with members of the \ncommunity early, prior to applying for a review or permit, the property owner or developer has an \nopportunity to tailor the proposal in response to community comments, ideas or concerns. \n33.705.020 Neighborhood Contact Steps  \nA.

It contains the step-\nby-step processing requirements. The chapter also describes the rules of conduct for all people \ninvolved in the quasi-judicial review process. The assignment of procedures to specific reviews is \ndone in the chapter that establishes the review. The assignment of the review body is done in \nChapter 33.720, Assignment of Review Bodies. \nThe regulations provide standardized methods for processing quasi-judicial land use reviews. The \nrequirements provide clear and consistent rules to ensure that the legal rights of individual property \nowners and the public are protected. The rules implement state law, including the requirement that \nmost quasi-judicial reviews must be completed within 120 days of filing a complete application, or \n100 days if the project qualifies as an affordable housing project under ORS 197.311, or as required \nby state law. The Type II, Type IIx, Type III, and Type IV procedures, with their varying levels of  Chapter 33.730 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nQuasi-Judicial Procedures 10/1/24 \n 730-2 \nreview, provide the City with options when assigning procedures to each quasi-judicial review in this \nTitle. The Type I and Type Ix procedures are administrative procedures. \nThe Type I and Ix procedures, or limited land use review, allows local decisions to be made \nadministratively for such reviews as minor design and historic resource cases. The Type II procedure \nis the shortest and simplest of the other three quasi-judicial reviews. It is intended for reviews which \ninvolve lesser amounts of discretion, lower potential impacts, or both. The Type IIx procedure is \nused primarily for land divisions. It provides more time to make the administrative decision than the \nType II procedure. The Type III procedure is a longer and more in-depth review. It is intended for \nreviews which involve substantial discretion or high impacts. The Type IV procedure is used to \nreview proposals to demolish certain significant historic resources. \nBasic Procedures \n33.730.013 Expedited Land Division Procedure \nAn Expedited Land Division (ELD) is an administrative process with public notice but no hearing. The \nExpedited Land Division (ELD) procedure provides an alternative to the standard procedures for \nsome land divisions. In some cases the zoning code assigns this procedure. In other cases, the \napplicant may choose to use the ELD process if the land division request meets all of the elements \nspecified in ORS 197.360.  \nA. Neighborhood contact.  \n1. When the ELD includes four to ten lots, the applicant is required to meet the \nneighborhood contact requirements specified in 33.705.020.A., Neighborhood contact \nI. If the proposed expedited land division is a middle housing land division or is in an \nEG or I zone, it is exempt from the neighborhood contact requirements. \n2. When the ELD includes eleven or more lots, the applicant is required to meet the \nneighborhood contact requirements specified in 33.705.020.A., Neighborhood contact \nII. If the proposed expedited land division is a middle housing land division or is in the \nEG1, EG2, or an I zone, it is exempt from the neighborhood contact requirements. \nB. Pre-application conference. A pre-application conference is required for all land division \nrequests processed through the ELD procedure, except for middle housing land divisions. \nSee 33.730.050.A., Pre-Application Conference. The pre-application conference must be \nheld before applying for an ELD review. \nC. Application. The applicant must submit an application on the appropriate form and \naccompanied by the correct fee. The application must contain all information required by \n33.730.060, Application Requirements, and any additional information required for the \nspecific type of land use review. \nD. Preliminary notice. Upon receipt of a complete application, the Director of PP&D will mail \na notice of the request to the owner, the applicant if different, any state agency, local \ngovernment or special district responsible for providing public facilities or services, all \nproperty owners within 100 feet of the site when within the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) \nand within 500 feet when outside the UGB, to the recognized organization(s) in which the \nsite is located, and to all recognized organizations within 400 feet of the site.

The \ncombination is necessary to provide a comprehensive set of implementation tools. The \nnondiscretionary reviews provide the certainty needed in most situations by providing straight-\nforward, clear, and objective standards. Discretionary reviews provide needed flexibility by allowing \nmore subjective standards and objectives, and providing for the modification of regulations in \nresponse to specific site conditions. This chapter addresses discretionary reviews. Nondiscretionary \nreviews are addressed in 33.700.010. \n33.800.020 Explanation of Discretionary Reviews \nA discretionary review is one that involves judgment or discretion in determining compliance with \nthe approval requirements. The review is discretionary because not all of the approval \nrequirements are objective. That is, they are not easily definable or measurable. The amount of \ndiscretion and the potential impact of the request varies among different reviews. Some have less \ndiscretion or impact, such as the reduction of a garage setback for a house on a hillside. Others may \ninvolve more discretion or potential impacts, such as the design review of a new downtown building \nor the siting of a new school in a residential zone. Discretionary reviews must provide opportunities \nfor public involvement. \n33.800.030 Procedures and Review Bodies for Discretionary Reviews \nProcedures are the type of processing a land use case receives. Discretionary reviews are assigned \neither to a quasi-judicial or legislative procedure. The type of procedure is stated with the review. A \ndescription of the procedures are stated in Chapter 33.730, Quasi-Judicial Procedures and Chapter \n33.740, Legislative Procedure. The assignment of review bodies is stated in Chapter 33.720, \nAssignment of Review Bodies. A description of quasi-judicial and legislative decisions is found in \n33.700.070. When formulating zoning regulations, the determination of which of the quasi-judicial \nprocedures to assign a review to is based on consideration of the type of approval criteria, the \npotential impacts, and a balance between the need for prompt decision-making and the need for \npublic involvement.   Chapter 33.800  Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nGeneral Information on Land Use Reviews  4/22/06 \n \n800-2 \n33.800.040 The Land Use Review Chapters \nThe land use review chapters state the review process and approval criteria for most of the \ndiscretionary reviews. They include the reviews that apply to many zones or situations. Some \nreviews, which relate only to a specific topic or to a limited area, are located in the chapter on that \ntopic. The information in this chapter applies to all discretionary reviews regardless of where they \nare located in this Title. \n33.800.050 The Function of Approval Criteria \nA. The approval criteria that are listed with a specific review reflect the findings that must be \nmade to approve a request. The criteria set the bounds for the issues that must be \naddressed by the applicant and which may be raised by the City or affected parties. A \nproposal that complies with all of the criteria will be approved. A proposal that can comply \nwith the criteria with mitigation measures or limitations will be approved with conditions. \nA proposal that cannot comply with the criteria outright or cannot comply with mitigation \nmeasures will be denied. \nB. The approval criteria have been derived from and are based on the Comprehensive Plan. \nReviews against the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan are not required unless \nspecifically stated. Fulfillment of all requirements and approval criteria means the proposal \nis in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan. \nC. When approval criteria refer to the request meeting a specific threshold, such as adequacy \nof services or no significant detrimental environmental impacts, the review body will \nconsider any proposed improvements, mitigation measures, or limitations proposed as \npart of the request when reviewing whether the request meets the threshold. All proposed \nimprovements, mitigation measures, and limitations must be submitted for consideration \nprior to a final decision by a review body. \n33.800.060 The Burden of Proof \nThe burden of proof is on the applicant to show that the approval criteria are met. The burden is \nnot on the City or other parties to show that the criteria have not been met. \n33.800.070 Conditions of Approval \nThe City may attach conditions to the approval of all discretionary reviews. However, conditions \nmay be applied only to ensure that the proposal will conform to the applicable approval criteria for \nthe review or to ensure the enforcement of other City regulations. \n33.800.080 Land Use Reviews Involving Signs \nThe discretionary review processes and approval criteria described in the land use review chapters \nmay also be applied to signs. Signs are regulated under Title 32, Signs and Related Regulations. \nModifications may be made to the objective standards of Chapters 32.32 and 32.34 of the Sign \nCode, as described in the land use review chapters. In addition, conditions of approval may be \nadopted as part of a land use review which modify the objective standards of Chapters 32.32 and \n32.34 of the Sign Code. \n \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.800 \n4/22/06 General Information on Land Use Reviews \n \n800-3 \n \n(Amended by: Ord.

These regulations apply city-wide, but because of the city's diversity, some \nsites are difficult to develop in compliance with the regulations. The adjustment review process \nprovides a mechanism by which the regulations in the zoning code may be modified if the proposed \ndevelopment continues to meet the intended purpose of those regulations. Adjustments may also \nbe used when strict application of the zoning code's regulations would preclude all use of a site. \nAdjustment reviews provide flexibility for unusual situations. They also allow for alternative ways to \nmeet the purposes of the code, while allowing the zoning code to continue to provide certainty and \nrapid processing for land use applications. \n33.805.020 Procedure \nRequests for an adjustment are processed through a Type II procedure. \n33.805.030 Regulations Which May and May Not Be Adjusted \nA. Eligible regulations. Unless listed in Subsection B. below, all regulations in this Title and in \nChapters 32.32 and 32.34 of the Sign Code may be modified using the adjustment  \nreview process. \nB. Ineligible regulations. Adjustments are prohibited for the following items: \n1. To allow a primary or accessory use that is not allowed by the regulations;  \n2. As an exception to any restrictions on uses or development which contain the  \nword \"prohibited\"; \n3. As an exception to a threshold for a review. An example is 33.140.100.B.4 in the \nEmployment and Industrial Zones chapter. It states that a single Office use 3,000 \nsquare feet or less is allowed by right, but larger ones require a conditional use \nreview. An adjustment could not be granted to allow an Office use of 3,200 square \nfeet; the conditional use review is mandatory; \n4. As an exception to a qualifying situation for a regulation, such as zones allowed or \nitems being limited to new development. An example of this is 33.251.030.C, which \nsays that manufactured dwelling parks are allowed only in the RM1 zone. An \nadjustment could not be granted to allow a manufactured dwelling park in any other R \nzone;  \n5. As an exception to a definition or classification. An example is the definition of \nbasement, which specifies that at least 50 percent of the total combined area of the  Chapter 33.805 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nAdjustments 1/1/25 \n \n805-2 \nbasement walls must be below grade to be considered a basement. An adjustment \ncould not be granted to change the area of the basement walls that must be below \ngrade; \n6. As an exception to the procedural steps of a procedure or to change  \nassigned procedures;  \n7. Except as allowed by other chapters, to allow an increase in density in the RF through \nRM2 or RMP zones.  \n33.805.040 Approval Criteria \nThe approval criteria for signs are stated in Title 32. All other adjustment requests will be approved \nif the review body finds that the applicant has shown that either approval criteria A. through F. or \napproval criteria G. through I., below, have been met.  \nA. Granting the adjustment will equally or better meet the purpose of the regulation to be \nmodified; and  \nB. If in a residential, CI1, or IR zone, the proposal will not significantly detract from the \nlivability or appearance of the residential area, or if in an OS, C, E, I, or CI2 zone, the \nproposal will be consistent with the classifications of the adjacent streets and the desired \ncharacter of the area; and  \nC. If more than one adjustment is being requested, the cumulative effect of the adjustments \nresults in a project which is still consistent with the overall purpose of the zone; and  \nD. City-designated scenic resources and historic resources in Historic, Conservation and \nNational Register Districts and within the boundaries of Historic, Conservation and National \nRegister Landmarks are preserved; and \nE. Any impacts resulting from the adjustment are mitigated to the extent practical; and \nF. If in an environmental zone, the proposal has as few significant detrimental environmental \nimpacts on the resource and resource values as is practicable; or \nG. Application of the regulation in question would preclude all reasonable economic use of \nthe site; and  \nH. Granting the adjustment is the minimum necessary to allow the use of the site; and  \nI. Any impacts resulting from the adjustment are mitigated to the extent practical. \n \n(Amended by: Ord. No. 167127, effective 12/17/93; Ord. No. 169987, effective 7/1/96; Ord.

The criteria in \nSection 33.808.100 apply to all CCPRs.  \n33.808.040 Review Procedures \nA. Type II. Except as specified in Subsection B., requests for Central City Parking Review are \nprocessed through a Type II procedure.  \nB. Type Ix. Requests for Preservation Parking are processed through a Type Ix procedure. \n33.808.050 Loss of Central City Parking Review Status \nIf the site of a Central City Parking Review is not used for parking for 3 continuous years, the Central \nCity Parking Review rights are lost. Any new parking on the site will be subject to current regulations, \nand will be reviewed as a new use. Parking spaces in surface parking lots occupied by vending carts \nare still considered to be parking spaces.  \n33.808.100 Approval Criteria for Central City Parking Review \nThe request will be approved if the review body finds that the applicant has shown that all of the \nfollowing approval criteria are met: \nA. The proposal will not by itself, or in combination with other parking facilities in the area, \nsignificantly lessen the overall desired character of the area. The desired character of the \narea is determined by City-adopted area, neighborhood, or development plans; by \nComprehensive Plan designations and zoning, and by allowed densities.  \nB. If the proposal is for Preservation Parking, and the parking is not under the same ownership \nas the buildings for which the parking is provided, criteria B.1 through B.3, below, apply. If \nthe proposal is to convert Visitor Parking to Preservation Parking, criteria B.1 through B.4, \nbelow, apply. \n1. The agreements between the garage operator and the owners of the buildings for \nwhich the parking is provided are for at least 10 years; and  Chapter 33.808 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nCentral City Parking Review 8/10/20 \n \n808-2 \n \n2. For initial approval, the agreements cover 100 percent of the Preservation Parking. \n3. There must be a Parking Management Plan that includes measures to ensure that: \na. The parking is used primarily for commitments of at least 10 years to buildings \nthat have fewer than 0.7 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of net building area \nfor commercial uses, 0.5 spaces per dwelling unit for residential uses, and 0.5 \nspaces per hotel room for hotel uses. All parking available to each building \napproved through previous Preservation Parking agreements are counted toward \nthis total. \nb. Other uses of the parking will occur only when the spaces are not used by the \ncontracted parkers. \n4. The parking demand analysis shows there is not a need for Visitor Parking at  \nthis location.  \nC. If the proposal is for Visitor Parking, the parking demand analysis shows a need for this \nparking at this location. The analysis must show the following criteria are met: \n1. At least 65 percent of the short term parking demand is from uses within 750 feet of \nthe parking structure or lot; and \n2. At least one of the following is met: \na. There is a cumulative increase in short-term parking demand due to an overall \nincrease in activity associated with existing or new retail or other visitor-related \nuses; or \nb. The parking will serve major new attractions or retail development, or \nc. There has been a significant loss of on-street parking due to recent public works \nprojects, or \nd. There has been a significant loss of short-term parking spaces.  \n3. There must be a parking management plan that includes measures to ensure that the \nparking will be primarily used for short-term parking. \n4. If the site is in an I zone, all of the following are met: \na. The parking will primarily serve industrial firms;  \nb. The parking facility will not have significant adverse effects on nearby industrial \nfirms; and  \nc. The parking facility will not significantly alter the overall industrial character of the \narea, based on the existing proportion of industrial and non-industrial uses and \nthe effects of incremental changes.  \n5. The transportation system is capable of safely supporting the proposed facility in \naddition to the existing uses in the area. Evaluation is based on the transportation \nimpact analysis and includes factors such as street capacity and level of service, on-\nstreet parking impacts, access requirements, impacts on transit operations and  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.808 \n8/10/20 Central City Parking Review \n \n808-3 \n \nmovement, impacts on the immediate and adjacent neighborhoods, and pedestrian \nand bicycle safety.   \n6.

procedures and review criteria necessary to process a Comprehensive Plan \nMap amendment. The chapter distinguishes between amendments which are processed in a quasi-\njudicial manner and those processed in a legislative manner. A discussion of quasi-judicial and \nlegislative is found in 33.700.070.H. \n33.810.020 Initiating a Comprehensive Plan Map Amendment \nA. Quasi-Judicial. Requests for Comprehensive Plan Map amendments which are quasi-\njudicial may be initiated by an applicant, the Planning Commission, or the City Council. The \nDirector of PP&D may request the Planning Commission to initiate an amendment. \nInitiations by a review body are made without prejudice towards the outcome. \nB. Legislative. Requests for Comprehensive Plan Map amendments which are legislative may \nbe initiated by the Planning Commission or the City Council. Others may request the \nPlanning Commission to consider an initiation. Initiations by a review body are made \nwithout prejudice towards the outcome. \n33.810.030 Concurrent Zone Changes Allowed \nRequests for zoning map amendments may be considered concurrently with a Comprehensive Plan \nMap amendment. Zoning map amendments must be to a zone corresponding to the requested \nComprehensive Plan Map designation. Concurrent zoning map amendments must meet all the \napproval criteria of Chapter 33.855, Zoning Map Amendments. \n33.810.040 Procedure \nA. Quasi-Judicial. Requests for a Comprehensive Plan Map amendment which are quasi-\njudicial are reviewed through a Type III procedure. City Council adoption is also required for \nthese requests. In addition, any post-acknowledgement procedures required by the State \nmust be followed. \nB. Legislative. Requests for a Comprehensive Plan Map amendment which are legislative are \nreviewed through the legislative procedure stated in Chapter 33.740.  Chapter 33.810 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nComprehensive Plan Map Amendments  3/1/24 \n \n810-2 \n33.810.050 Approval Criteria \nA. Quasi-Judicial. Amendments to the Comprehensive Plan Map that are quasi-judicial will be \napproved if the review body finds that the applicant has shown that all of the following \ncriteria are met: \n1. The requested designation for the site has been evaluated against relevant \nComprehensive Plan policies and on balance has been found to be equally or more \nsupportive of the Comprehensive Plan as a whole than the old designation; \n2.  The requested change is consistent with Statewide Land Use Planning Goals; \n3. In order to prevent the displacement of industrial and employment uses and preserve \nland primarily for these uses, the following criteria must be met when the requested \namendment is from an Industrial Sanctuary or Mixed Employment Comprehensive \nPlan Map designation: \na. The uses allowed by the proposed designation will not have significant adverse \neffects on industrial and employment uses in the area or compromise the area’s \noverall industrial character; \nb. The transportation system is capable of supporting the uses allowed by the \nproposed designation in addition to the existing uses in the area. Evaluation \nfactors include safety, street capacity, level of service, connectivity, transit \navailability, availability of pedestrian and bicycle networks, access restrictions, \nneighborhood impacts, impacts on pedestrian, bicycle, and transit circulation. \nEvaluation factors may be balanced; a finding of failure in one or more factors \nmay be acceptable if the failure is not a result of the proposed development, and \nany additional impacts on the system from the proposed development are \nmitigated as required by criterion A.3.c; \nc. Measures proportional to the impacts of the uses allowed by the proposed \ndesignation are proposed to mitigate on- and off-site transportation impacts. \nMeasures may include transportation improvements to on-site circulation, public \nstreet dedication and improvement, private street improvements, intersection \nimprovements, signal or other traffic management improvements, additional \ntransportation and parking demand management actions, street crossing \nimprovements, improvements to the local pedestrian and bicycle networks, and \ntransit improvements; and \nd. Transportation improvements adjacent to the development and in the vicinity \nneeded to support the proposed development are available or will be made \navailable when the development is complete or, if the development is phased, \nwill be available as each phase of the development is completed. \ne. The uses allowed by the proposed designation will not significantly interfere with \nindustrial use of the transportation system in the area, including truck, rail, air, \nand marine facilities; \nf. The site does not have direct access to special industrial services such as \nmultimodal freight movement facilities;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.810 \n3/1/24 Comprehensive Plan Map Amendments \n \n810-3 \ng. The proposed designation will preserve the physical continuity of the area \ndesignated as Industrial Sanctuary or Mixed Employment and not result in a \ndiscontinuous zoning pattern; \nh. The uses allowed by the proposed designation will not reduce the ability of \nPortland’s Central City, Regional or Town Centers to attract or retain the principal \nretail, cultural, and civic facilities; and \ni. The size of the area that may be given a new Comprehensive Plan Map \ndesignation is as follows: \n(1) If the site is designated Industrial Sanctuary, and Metro also has designated \nthe site as part of a Regionally Significant Industrial Area, no more than 10 \nacres may be given a new Comprehensive Plan Map designation; \n(2) If the site is designated Industrial Sanctuary, and Metro has designated the \nsite as an Industrial Area, but not as part of a Regionally Significant \nIndustrial Area, no more than 20 acres may be given a new Comprehensive \nPlan Map designation; \n(3) If the site is designated Industrial Sanctuary, and Metro has designated the \nsite as an Employment Area, no more than 40 acres may be given a new \nComprehensive Plan Map designation; \n(4) If the site is designated Mixed Employment, no more than 40 acres may be \ngiven a new Comprehensive Plan Map designation; \n(5) Exception. If the site is not designated as industrial or employment by \nMetro, these size limits do not apply. \nB. Legislative. Amendments to the Comprehensive Plan Map which are legislative must be \nfound to be consistent with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, Metro’s \nUrban Growth Management Functional Plan, the Statewide Planning Goals, and any \nrelevant area plans adopted by the City Council. \n33.810.070 Recently Annexed Areas \nAreas annexed into the City will automatically receive City Comprehensive Plan designations as part \nof the process of applying comparable zoning. See 33.855.080, Recently Annexed Areas. \n33.810.080 Corrections to the Comprehensive Plan Map \nThe Director of PP&D may initiate a review through the Type II procedure for the types of \ncorrections to the Comprehensive Plan Map listed below. Nondiscretionary corrections to the \nComprehensive Plan Map may be initiated by the Director of Planning and Sustainability as \ndescribed in Section 1.01.037 of the Portland City Code. \nA. Mapping errors. The correction may be made for mapping errors such as: \n1. A map line that was intended to follow a topographical feature does not do so. \nTopographical features include the tops and bottoms of hillsides, the banks of water \nbodies, and center lines of creeks or drainage ditches;  Chapter 33.810 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nComprehensive Plan Map Amendments  3/1/24 \n \n810-4 \n2. T here is a discrepancy between maps and on balance there is sufficient evidence of \nlegislative intent for where the line should be located. \nB. Movement of the reference item for the map line. The correction may be made when a \nmap line is based on the location of a reference item that has since been moved. Reference \nitems are rights-of-way, tentative rights-of-way, utility easements and similar items. Map \nline changes in these cases must not be more than a trivial change to the map pattern and \nmust not result in any significant impacts to abutting lots. \n \n(Amended by: Ord.

They are subject to the conditional use \nregulations because they may, but do not necessarily, have significant adverse effects on the \nenvironment, overburden public services, change the desired character of an area, or create major \nnuisances. A review of these uses is necessary due to the potential individual or cumulative impacts \nthey may have on the surrounding area or neighborhood. The conditional use review provides an \nopportunity to allow the use when there are minimal impacts, to allow the use but impose \nmitigation measures to address identified concerns, or to deny the use if the concerns cannot be \nresolved.  \n33.815.020 How to Use this Chapter \nUses that require a conditional use review and are subject to the regulations of this chapter are \nstated in the use tables of the base zones or in the regulations of overlay zones or plan districts \nwhich apply to the site. The review procedures for various conditional use situations are stated in \n33.815.040 below. Requirements for phased master plans which may be submitted as part of a \nconditional use application are stated in Chapter 33.820, Conditional Use Master Plans.  \nThe applicable approval criteria are stated in Sections 33.815.100 to .305.  \n33.815.030 Automatic Conditional Use Status \nOver time, the zoning regulations applicable to a specific site may change. This may be a result of \nchanges to the content of the zoning regulations for a specific zone or from a change to the zoning \nmap, including annexation rezonings. After one of these changes, if an existing use was allowed by \nright or was a nonconforming use, and is now listed as a conditional use, the use is considered an \napproved conditional use and may continue to operate. Any changes to the use are subject to the \nprocedures of 33.815.040 and the appropriate approval criteria.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.815 \n10/1/24 Conditional Uses \n \n815-3 \n33.815.040 Review Procedures  \nThe procedure for reviewing conditional uses depends on how the proposal affects the use of, or the \ndevelopment on, the site. Subsection A, below, outlines the procedures for proposals that affect the \nuse of the site while Subsection B outlines the procedures for proposals that affect the development \nor reduce the conditional use site boundary. Proposals may be subject to Subsection A or B or both. \nThe review procedures of this section apply unless specifically stated otherwise in this Title. \nProposals may also be subject to the provisions of 33.700.040, Reconsideration of Land Use \nApprovals. \nA. Proposals that affect the use of the site. \n1. A new conditional use. A request for a new conditional use is processed through a \nType III procedure. \n2. Changing to another use: \na. In the same use category, such as from one Community Service use to another \nCommunity Service use. \n(1) Except as specified in subparagraph A.2.a(2), below, changing from one \nconditional use to another conditional use in the same use category is \nprocessed through a Type II procedure; \n(2) If changing from one conditional use to another conditional use in the same \nuse category will also change a specifically approved amount of the previous \nuse, such as members, students, trips, or events, by more than 10 percent, \nthe change of use is processed through a Type III procedure; \nb. In another use category.  \n(1) Changing to a conditional use in another use category is processed through \na Type III procedure. \n(2) Changing to an allowed use is allowed by right. \n3. Adding another use. \na.

Expansions of the use may have impacts on surrounding neighborhoods \nand on public services that are better addressed through the review of the master plan than through \nreviewing the expansions individually over time. In addition, by creating long term plans, some \nimpacts may be prevented that would have occurred with uncoordinated piecemeal expansions. The \ndevelopment of a master plan is intended to provide the surrounding neighborhoods and the City \nwith information about, and an opportunity to comment on, the use's plans for future development. \nThe plan also enables the operator of the use and the City to address the effects of the future \ndevelopment. Finally, an approved master plan is intended to ensure that the use will be allowed to \ndevelop in a manner consistent with the plan. Master plans may be completed at various levels of \ndetail. Generally, the more specific the plan, the less review that will be required as the future uses \nand development are built.  \n33.820.020 What Is Covered by a Master Plan \nA. Present uses. A conditional use master plan is for the entire use, including portions of the \nuse on lands where the use is allowed by right, and all affiliates on or abutting the site. For \nthe purpose of this chapter, an affiliate means any entity that is related to the use in such a \nway that either the use or the entity controls the other, or both are under control of a third \nparty. Control means the power to decide and direct the use of land, structures, and other \nresources. \nB. Proposed and potential uses. The conditional use master plan covers any specific uses or \ndevelopment proposals being requested, called the \"proposed use\" in this chapter, and \npossible future uses or development, called the \"possible future uses.\" \nC. Boundaries. The conditional use master plan may encompass lands not presently \ncontrolled by the use. The plan will not take effect for those lands until they are under \ncontrol of the applicant.   Chapter 33.820 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nConditional Use Master Plans 10/1/24 \n \n820-2 \n33.820.030 When a Master Plan Is Required \nA conditional use master plan is required as part of a conditional use review in the situations  \nlisted below.  \nA. Large conditional uses. The conditional use contains over 500,000 square feet of floor area \nand either: \n1. The use proposes to expand the amount of floor area over 10 percent from the \namount that existed at the last conditional use review, or if there was no review, then \nJanuary 1, 1991 or  \n2. The use expands its site area beyond the site area that existed on January 1, 1991. For \nthis regulation, site area means all land used by the use and its affiliates including \nvacant land within the ownership. \nB. When required as part of a conditional use review. The review body, as part of a \nconditional use review, may require a master plan in conjunction with any future \nexpansions of the use if there has been a history of site area expansions and these are \nlikely to continue. Also, the master plan may be required for future expansion of the use if \nthere has been a history of floor area expansions for functions of the use which draw \nadditional people to the site, and these are likely to continue. \nC. Voluntarily. An applicant may also voluntarily submit a master plan as part of a conditional \nuse review. \n33.820.040 Procedure \nConditional use master plans are processed through a Type III procedure as part of the conditional \nuse review. The applicant is encouraged to work with surrounding property owners, residents, \nrecognized organizations, and City bureaus during the formulation of the master plan. \n33.820.050 Approval Criteria \nRequests for conditional use master plans will be approved if the review body finds that the \napplicant has shown that all of the following approval criteria are met:  \nA. The master plan contains the components required by 33.820.070; \nB. The proposed uses and possible future uses in the master plan comply with the applicable \nconditional use approval criteria; and  \nC. The proposed uses and possible future uses will be able to comply with the applicable \nrequirements of this Title, except where adjustments are being approved as part of the \nmaster plan.  \n33.820.060 Duration of the Master Plan \nThe master plan must include proposed uses and possible future uses that might be proposed for at \nleast 3 years and up to 10 years. Generally, an approved master plan remains in effect until \ndevelopment allowed by the plan has been completed or the plan is amended or superseded.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.820 \n10/1/24 Conditional Use Master Plans \n \n820-3 \n33.820.070 Components of a Master Plan  \nThe applicant must submit a master plan with all of the following components. The review body may \nmodify the proposal, especially those portions dealing with development standards and review \nprocedures. The greater the level of detail in the plan, the less need for extensive reviews of \nsubsequent phases. Conversely, the more general the details, the greater the level of review that \nwill be required for subsequent phases. \nA. Boundaries of the use. The master plan must show the current boundaries and possible \nfuture boundaries of the use for the duration of the master plan. \nB. General statement. The master plan must include a narrative that addresses the  \nfollowing items: \n1. A description in general terms of the use's expansion plans for the duration of the \nmaster plan; \n2. An explanation of how the proposed uses and possible future uses comply with the \nconditional use approval criteria; and  \n3. An explanation of how the use will limit impacts on any adjacent residentially zoned \nareas. The impacts of the removal of housing units must also be addressed. \nC. Uses and functions. The master plan must include a description of present uses, affiliated \nuses, proposed uses, and possible future uses. The description must include information as \nto the general amount and type of functions of the use such as office, classroom, \nrecreation area, housing, etc. The likely hours of operation, and such things as the \napproximate number of members, employees, visitors, special events must be included. \nOther uses within the master plan boundary but not part of the conditional use must  \nbe shown.  \nD. Site plan. The master plan must include a site plan, showing to the appropriate level of \ndetail, buildings and other structures, the pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicle circulation \nsystem, vehicle and bicycle parking areas, open areas, existing trees to be preserved, and \nother required items. In addition to the application requirements in 33.730.060.C, the site \nplan must also include:  \n1. All existing improvements that will remain after development of the proposed use; \n2. All improvements planned in conjunction with the proposed use;  \n3. Conceptual plans for possible future uses; and \n4. Pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities including pedestrian and bicycle  \ncirculation between: \na. Major buildings, activity areas, and transit stops within the master plan \nboundaries and adjacent streets and adjacent transit stops; and \nb. Adjacent developments and the proposed development. \nE. Development standards. The master plan may propose standards that will control \ndevelopment of the possible future uses that are in addition to or substitute for the base \nzone requirements and the requirements of Chapters 32.32 and 32.34 of the Sign Code.  Chapter 33.820 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nConditional Use Master Plans 10/1/24 \n \n820-4 \nThese may be such things as height limits, setbacks, FAR limits, landscaping and tree \npreservation requirements, parking requirements, sign programs, view corridors, or facade \ntreatments. Standards more liberal than those of the code require adjustments. \nF. Phasing of development. The master plan must include the proposed development phases, \nprobable sequence for proposed developments, estimated dates, and interim uses of \nproperty awaiting development. In addition the plan should address any proposed \ntemporary uses or locations of uses during construction periods. \nG. Transportation and parking. The master plan must include information on the following \nitems for each phase.  \n1. Projected transportation impacts. These include the expected number of trips (peak, \nevents, and daily), an analysis of the impact of those trips on the adjacent street \nsystem, and proposed mitigation measures to limit any projected negative impacts. \nMitigation measures may include improvements to the street system or specific \nprograms and strategies to reduce traffic impacts such as encouraging the use of \npublic transit, carpools, vanpools, and other alternatives to single occupant vehicles.  \n2. Projected parking impacts. These include projected peak parking demand, an analysis \nof this demand compared to proposed on-site and off-site supply, potential impacts to \nthe on-street parking system and adjacent land uses, and mitigation measures.  \nH. Street vacations. The master plan must show any street vacations being requested in \nconjunction with the proposed use and any possible street vacations that might be \nrequested in conjunction with future development. (Street vacations are under the \njurisdiction of the City Engineer. Approval of the master plan does not prejudice City action \non the actual street vacation request.) \nI. Adjustments. The master plan must specifically list any adjustments being requested in \nconjunction with the proposed use or overall development standards and explain how each \nadjustment complies with the adjustment approval criteria. \nJ. Other discretionary reviews. When design review or other required reviews are also being \nrequested, the master plan must specifically state which phases or proposals the reviews \napply to. The required reviews for all phases may be done as part of the initial master plan \nreview, or may be done separately at the time of each new phase of development. The \nplan must explain and provide enough detail on how the proposals comply with the \napproval criteria for the review.  \nK. Review procedures. The master plan must state the procedures for review of possible \nfuture uses if the plan does not contain adequate details for those uses to be allowed \nwithout a conditional use review.  \n33.820.080 Implementation  \nA. Conforming to the plan. Uses and development that are in conformance with detailed \naspects of the plan are not required to go through another conditional use review. Uses \nand development subject to less detailed parts of the plan are subject to the level of \nconditional use review stated in the master plan. They will be approved if they are found to  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.820 \n10/1/24 Conditional Use Master Plans \n \n820-5 \ncomply with the master plan. Other required land use reviews must still be completed \nunless they were also approved as part of the master plan. \nB. Not conforming to the plan. Uses that are not in conformance with the master plan require \nan amendment to the plan. Development that is not in conformance with the plan and \ndoes not meet the following requires an amendment to the plan. Development that is not \nin conformance with the plan and does meet all of the following is allowed: \n1. All conditions of approval must be met except as allowed by Subparagraphs B.4 \nthrough B.8; \n2. One of the following must be met: \na. Complies with the development standards of this Title, or \nb. Does not comply with the development standards of this Title, but an adjustment \nor modification to the development standards has been approved through a land \nuse review; \n3. Either maintains the existing site boundary or reduces the site boundary along a lot \nline. If the proposal reduces the conditional use site boundary along a lot line, the \nboundary reduction will not eliminate the availability of services to the properties and \nthe properties will not move out of conformance with service bureau requirements for \nwater, sanitary sewage disposal, and stormwater management; \n4. Does not demolish and replace more than 25 percent of the existing floor area on the \nsite; \n5. Does not increase new floor area by more than 2,000 square feet. Floor area for an \noutdoor shelter and for housing that is affordable is exempt from this limitation. For \nthe purposes of this paragraph, housing that is affordable means that at least 50 \npercent of the dwelling units in the additional floor area are participating in the Title \n30 System Development Charges Exemption Program. See 30.01.095. If the additional \nfloor area is in multiple buildings with multiple dwelling units, then the affordable \nunits must be distributed among the multiple buildings. To qualify for this exemption, \nthe applicant must provide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying which \nunits are approved for the System Development Charges Exemption Program; \n6. Does not increase the exterior improvement area by more than 2,000 square feet, \nexcept that exterior improvements associated with an outdoor shelter, fences, \nhandicap access ramps, on-site pedestrian circulation systems, ground mounted solar \npanels, and parking space increases allowed by 33.820.080.B.8 below, are exempt \nfrom this limitation; \n7. Will not result in a net gain of site area; \n8. Will not result in an individual or cumulative loss or gain in the number of parking \nspaces, except as follows: \na. Will not result in a net loss in the number of parking spaces except as follows: \n(1) No reduction in shared parking spaces is allowed;   Chapter 33.820 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nConditional Use Master Plans 10/1/24 \n \n820-6 \n(2) Up to 50 percent of the total number of existing parking spaces may be \nremoved when the removal is for an outdoor shelter or housing that is \naffordable as defined by Paragraph B.5; \n(3) 1 space or 4 percent of the total number of parking spaces may be removed, \nwhichever is greater; however, parking spaces removed to create accessible \nspaces as specified in the Oregon Structural Specialty Code are exempt from \nthis limitation; and \n(4) Removal of parking from sites with 4 or fewer parking spaces required by \nthe master plan is not allowed without an amendment to the plan. \nb. Will not increase the net number of parking spaces by more than 1 space or 4 \npercent of the total number of parking spaces, whichever is greater. However, \nthe individual or cumulative addition of more than 5 parking spaces is not \nallowed without an amendment to the plan; and  \nc. The cumulative loss of parking is measured from the time the use became a \nconditional use, July 16, 2004, or the last conditional use review of the use, \nwhichever is most recent, to the present. \n33.820.090 Amendments to Master Plans \nAmendments to the master plan are required for any use or development that is not in conformance \nwith the plan, except as stated in 33.820.080, above. The approval criteria of 33.820.050 apply. The \nthresholds and procedures for amendments are stated below.  \nA. Type III procedure. Unless the master plan specifically provides differently, amendments to \na master plan that require a Type III procedure are: \n1. Any proposed development on the site that is within 400 feet of the master plan \nboundaries, unless a greater distance is stated in the master plan;  \n2. A proposed expansion of the approved boundary; \n3. Proposals that increase the amount, frequency, or scale of a use over 10 percent of \nwhat was approved (Examples include the number of students, patients, or members; \nthe number of helicopter flights; number or size of special events.);  \n4. New uses not covered in the plan which will draw more people to the site, except for \nthose which are replacing another use so that there is no net increase;  \n5. Increases in the overall floor area of development on the site over 25 percent. Floor \narea for an outdoor shelter or housing that is affordable as defined by Paragraph B.5.is \nexempt from this limitation;   \n6. Increases or decreases greater than 10 percent in the amount of approved parking. \nDecreases for an outdoor shelter or housing that is affordable as defined by Paragraph \nB.5. are exempt from this limitation; and \n7. Proposed uses or development which were reviewed, but were denied because they \nwere found to not be in conformance with the plan.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.820 \n10/1/24 Conditional Use Master Plans \n \n820-7 \nB. Type II procedure. Unless the master plan specifically provides differently, amendments to \na master plan not specifically stated in Subsection A. above are processed through a  \nType II procedure. \n33.820.100 Existing Plans \nA. Plans in effect. Master plans that were approved by the City prior to January 1, 1991 are \ndeemed to be in conformance with this chapter and continue in effect until their expiration \ndates. Approved master plans that do not have an expiration date continue in effect until \ndevelopment allowed by the plan has been completed. \nB. Plans being formulated. Master plans submitted after the implementation date of this Title \nwhich were required because of conditions of a land use approval prior to the \nimplementation date, will be reviewed by the City in accordance with the original \nconditions. If the master plan is approved, it is then subject to the regulations of Subsection \nA. above. \n \n(Amended by: Ord. No. 170704, effective 1/1/97; Ord. No. 171219, effective 7/1/97; Ord.

Chapter 33.820 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nConditional Use Master Plans 10/1/24 \n \n820-8 \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.825 \n10/1/24 Design Review \n \n825-1 \n33.825 Design Review \n825 \n \nSections: \n33.825.010 Purpose \n33.825.025 Review Procedures \n33.825.035 Factors Reviewed During Design Review \n33.825.040 Modifications That Will Better Meet Design Review Requirements \n33.825.055 Approval Criteria  \n33.825.065 Design Guidelines \n33.825.075 Relationship to Other Regulations \n33.825.010 Purpose \nDesign review implements the Design overlay zone, strengthening these areas as places designed for \npeople. Design review supports development that builds on context, contributes to the public realm, \nand provides high quality and resilient buildings and public spaces. Design Review offers \nopportunities for increased flexibility over the design standards within Chapter 33.420. \n33.825.025 Review Procedures \nThis section lists procedures for design review for proposals in Design overlay zones. These \nprocedures also apply where design review is required by the regulations of a plan district or overlay \nzone, or as a condition of approval of a quasi-judicial decision.  \nThe procedures stated in this section supersede procedural and threshold statements in the City's \nadopted design guidelines documents. Procedures for design review vary with the type of proposal \nbeing reviewed and the geographic area in which the site is located. Some proposals in the Central \nCity plan district must provide a model of the approved proposal, as set out in Subsection D.  \nA. Proposals subject to design review are reviewed according to the procedure type listed in \nTable 825-1.  \n1. When a proposal is subject to more than one procedure type, the higher procedure \ntype applies. For example, a proposal may include both an alteration and an addition \nto a building. If the alteration is subject to a Type II procedure, but the addition is \nsubject to a Type III procedure, the proposal would be subject to a Type III procedure. \n2. Until January 1, 2029, when a proposal includes a residential use, the proposal may be \nsubject to the next lower procedure type as follows:  \na. If the proposal is subject to a Type III procedure, the applicant may choose a Type \nII procedure. A design advice request is required before the application for \ndesign review is submitted. See 730.050.B;  \nb. If the proposal is subject to a Type III procedure, the applicant may choose a Type \nIx or Type II procedure if at least 50 percent of the total number of dwelling units \non the site are affordable to those earning no more than 60 percent of the area \nmedian family income or an affordability level established by Title 30. If a Type Ix \nor Type II review procedure is chosen, the applicant must provide a letter from  Chapter 33.825 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nDesign Review 10/1/24 \n \n825-2 \nthe Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the development meets the \naffordability requirement and any administrative requirements of the Portland \nHousing Bureau; and  \nc. If the proposal is subject to a Type II procedure, the applicant may choose a Type \nIx procedure. \nB. Phased design plans. \n1. For multi-phased projects. Applicants may submit design plans for multi-phased \nprojects, provided the application includes adequate information to allow review of \nthe immediate and later phases of the project, including anticipated timelines. \n2. Benefits of a phased design plan. Development in conformance with an approved \nphased design plan does not have to go through a separate design review for each \nphase. \n3. Procedure. A phased design plan application is reviewed using the same procedure \nand with the same guidelines as a design review for a  \nspecific development. \nC. Models of proposals in the Central City plan district. For proposals located in the Central \nCity plan district shown on Map 510-1, a three dimensional digital model of the proposal is \nrequired with an application for Design Review. This requirement applies only to new \ndevelopments or changes in the bulk of existing buildings.  \n Before a building permit is issued, a three dimensional digital model of the proposal as \napproved must be submitted to the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability. The model \nrequirements will be waived if the application does not involve a change in the bulk of \nbuildings on a site for which the City possesses an accurate digital model.  \n \nTable 825-1 \nProcedure Type for Design Review Proposals \nGeographic Area Proposal Threshold Procedure \nCentral City Plan District \nNew development or \nnew building(s) on a site \nwith existing \ndevelopment  \n1) New floor area is  \n> 25,000 s.f. or \n2) New building height is > 45 ft.

If a Type II review procedure is chosen, \nthe applicant must provide a letter from the Portland Housing Bureau certifying that the development meets \nthe affordability requirement and any administrative requirements of the Portland Housing Bureau and a \ndesign advice request is required. See 33.730.050.B. The application for design review may not be submitted \nbefore the required design advice request is held.  \n[3] Changes to an approved design review are reviewed as stated in this table when all of the following are \nmet. Changes to an approved review that do not meet these thresholds are processed through the same \nprocedure as the original review: \n   1. The original design review has not expired; \n   2. The building permit for the project has not received final approval;  \n   3. The change will not modify any condition of approval. Changes to an approved exhibit are allowed; and  \n   4. The change alters no more than 30 percent of any façade and does not increase the approved floor area.  \n[4] If the original design review was processed through a Type I procedure, then review of a change is \nprocessed through the same procedure as the original review. \n \n33.825.035 Factors Reviewed During Design Review.  \nThe review may evaluate the architectural style; structure placement, dimensions, height, and bulk; \nlot coverage by structures; and exterior alterations of the proposal, including building materials, \ncolor, off-street parking areas, open areas, landscaping, and tree preservation. \nWhile the review may evaluate the distribution of massing and placement of structures on the site, \nthe review may not require the applicant to reduce or increase the total floor area or height, except  Chapter 33.825 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nDesign Review 10/1/24 \n \n825-4 \nwhen the height being proposed includes bonus height, and the bonus requires approval through \ndesign review or a modification through design review.  \nThe review body is not obligated to approve modifications or adjustments that are requested in \norder to achieve the proposed development intensity. \n33.825.040 Modifications That Will Better Meet Design Review Requirements \nThe review body may consider modification of site-related development standards, including the \nsign standards of Chapters 32.32 and 32.34 of the Sign Code, as part of the design review process. \nThe review body may not consider modifications to standards for which adjustments are prohibited. \nModifications are done as part of design review and are not required to go through the adjustment \nprocess. Adjustments to use-related development standards (such as floor area ratios, intensity of \nuse, size of the use, number of units, or other standards that are calculated based upon the size or \nintensity of the use such as the quantity of parking and loading spaces) are required to go through \nthe adjustment process. Modifications that are denied through design review may be requested as \nan adjustment through the adjustment process. The review body will approve requested \nmodifications if it finds that the applicant has shown that the following approval criteria are met: \nA. Better meets design guidelines. The resulting development will better meet the applicable \ndesign guidelines;  \nB. Purpose of the standard. On balance, the proposal will be consistent with the purpose of \nthe standard for which a modification is requested; and \nC. Mitigation of impacts. Any impacts resulting from the modifications are mitigated to the \nextent practical. \n33.825.055 Approval Criteria \nA design review application will be approved if the review body finds the applicant to have shown \nthat the proposal complies with the design guidelines for the area.  \n33.825.065 Design Guidelines \nA. Purpose. Design guidelines are the approval criteria used to review new development and \nalterations to existing development. They ensure that the development builds on the \ncontext of the area, contributes to the public realm and promotes quality and long-term \nresilience within the Design overlay zone.  \nB. Design guidelines. Guidelines specific to a design district have been adopted for the areas \nshown on maps 420-1 through 420-4. Where two of the design districts shown on those \nmaps overlap, both sets of guidelines apply. Projects within the South Auditorium Plan \nDistrict use the Central City Fundamental Design Guidelines for the Downtown Subdistrict. \n All other areas within the Design overlay zone or proposals subject to design review use the \nPortland Citywide Design Guidelines.  \n \nThe design guidelines are mandatory approval criteria used in design review procedures. \nWithin design districts, the design guidelines may consist of a common set of design \nguidelines for the whole district and special design guidelines for subdistricts. Where \nsubdistrict guidelines conflict with the district guidelines, the subdistrict guidelines control.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning  Chapter 33.825 \n10/1/24 Design Review \n \n825-5 \nC.

New additions, exterior alterations, or new construction \nwill not destroy historic materials that characterize a landmark or contributing \nresource. New work may be differentiated from the old if the differentiation does not \ndiminish the character, features, materials, form, or integrity of the landmark or \ncontributing resource and, if in a Historic District, the district as a whole; \n8. Architectural compatibility. New additions, exterior alterations, or new construction \nwill be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features of the \nlandmark or contributing resource and, if in a district, the district as a whole. When \nretrofitting to improve accessibility for persons with disabilities or accommodate \nseismic improvements, design solutions will not compromise the architectural \nintegrity of the landmark or contributing resource; \n9. Preserve the form and integrity of historic resources. New additions, exterior \nalterations, or new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that if removed  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.846 \n10/1/24 Historic Resource Reviews \n \n 846-19 \nin the future, the essential form and integrity of the landmark or contributing resource \nand, if in a district, the district as a whole would be unimpaired; and  \n10. Hierarchy of compatibility. New additions, exterior alterations, or new construction \nwill be designed to be compatible primarily with the landmark or contributing \nresource and, if located within a district, secondarily with contributing resources \nlocated within 200 feet and, finally, with the rest of the district. Where practical, \ncompatibility in districts will be pursued on all three levels. \nH.  Other conservation approval criteria. When required by Paragraphs E. or F., the following \napproval criteria must be met: \n1. Historic features. Generally, deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than \nreplaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement, the new feature \nwill match the historic feature in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, \nwhere practical, in materials. Replacement of missing features must be substantiated \nby documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence; \n2 Historic materials. Historic materials will be protected. Chemical or physical \ntreatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials will not be \nused; \n3. Differentiate new from old. New additions, exterior alterations, or new construction \nwill not destroy historic materials that characterize a landmark or contributing \nresource. New work may be differentiated from the old if the differentiation does not \ndiminish the features or materials of the landmark or contributing resource and, if in a \ndistrict, the district as a whole; \n4. Architectural coherency. New additions, exterior alterations, or new construction will \nrelate to the massing, materials, and architectural features of the landmark or \ncontributing resource and, if in a district, the district as a whole even if the new work \nis differentiated or of a larger scale than the old;  \n5. Archaeological resources. Significant archaeological resources affected by a proposal \nwill be protected and preserved to the extent practical. When such resources are \ndisturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken; and \n6. Cultural character. For landmarks or contributing resources in districts primarily \nsignificant for an area of history other than architecture or design, new additions, \nexterior alterations, or new construction will maintain the cultural significance of the \nresource. New additions, exterior alterations, or new construction may alter, replace, \nor remove historic features and materials if such features or materials are not integral \nto the resource’s cultural significance. \n \nI. Other relocation approval criteria. When required by Paragraphs E. or F., one of the \nfollowing approval criteria must be met: \n1. Maintaining the resource in its current location would effectively deprive the owner of \nall reasonable economic use of the site. The evaluation must consider the historic  Chapter 33.846 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHistoric Resource Reviews 10/1/24 \n \n846-20 \nresource’s age, historic significance, historic integrity, condition, value to the \ncommunity, and design or construction rarity. \n2. Relocation of the resource has been evaluated against the goals and policies of the \nComprehensive Plan and any relevant area plans and, on balance, relocation has been \nfound to be more supportive of the goals and policies than preservation, \nrehabilitation, or reuse of the resource on its current site.  \na. The evaluation must consider the historic resource’s age, historic significance, \nhistoric integrity, condition, value to the community, and design or construction \nrarity.  \nb. The evaluation must consider the merits of relocation, the merits of preserving \nthe resource on site, and the economic consequences of relocation.  \nc.  The evaluation may consider the following additional factors:  \n(1) The merits of the proposed development on the site after relocation;  \n(2) For contributing resources in a district with district-specific design \nguidelines, the design guidelines for the district; and \n(3) Any proposed mitigation for relocation. \n3. Relocation of the resource and related alterations will not substantially harm the \nhistoric significance and physical integrity of the resource.  \na. The evaluation must consider the historic resource’s age, historic significance, \nhistoric integrity, condition, value to the community, and design or construction \nrarity.  \nb. The evaluation must consider the merits of relocation, the merits of preserving \nthe resource on site, and the economic consequences of relocation.  \nc.  The evaluation may consider the following additional factors:  \n(1) The merits of the proposed development on the site after relocation;  \n(2) For contributing resources in a district with district-specific design \nguidelines, the design guidelines for the district; and \n(3) Any proposed mitigation for relocation. \n33.846.070 Modifications Considered During Historic Resource Review \nThe review body may consider modification of site-related development standards, including the \nsign standards of Chapters 32.32 and 32.34 of the Sign Code, as part of the historic resource review \nprocess. The review body may not consider modifications to standards for which adjustments are \nprohibited. Modifications are done as part of historic resource review and are not required to go \nthrough the adjustment process. Adjustments to use-related development standards (such as floor \narea ratios, intensity of use, size of the use, number of units, or other standards that are calculated \nbased upon the size or intensity of the use such as the quantity of parking and loading spaces) are \nrequired to go through the adjustment process. Modifications that are denied through historic \nresource review may be requested as an adjustment through the adjustment process. The review  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.846 \n10/1/24 Historic Resource Reviews \n \n 846-21 \nbody will approve requested modifications if it finds that the applicant has shown that the following \napproval criteria are met: \nA. Better meets historic resource review approval criteria. The resulting development will \nbetter meet the approval criteria for historic resource review than would a design that \nmeets the standard being modified; and \nB. Purpose of the standard. \n1. The resulting development will meet the purpose of the standard being modified; or  \n2. The preservation of the character of the historic resource is more important than \nmeeting the purpose of the standard for which a modification has been requested. \n33.846.080 Demolition Review \nA. Purpose. Demolition review protects landmarks and contributing resources in districts. \nDemolition review recognizes that historic resources are irreplaceable assets significant to \nthe region’s architectural, cultural, and historical identity and their preservation promotes \neconomic and community vitality, resilience, and memory. In the event that demolition of a \nhistoric resource is approved, demolition review also addresses the potential for mitigation \nof the loss.  \nB. Review procedure. Demolition reviews are processed as follows: \n1. Proposals to demolish an accessory structure are processed through a Type II \nprocedure; \n2. Proposals to demolish a Conservation Landmark, National Register Landmark, \ncontributing resource in a Conservation District, or contributing resource in a National \nRegister District are processed through a Type III procedure; \n3. All other proposals to demolish a historic resource are processed through a Type IV \nprocedure. \nC. Approval criteria. Proposals to demolish a historic resource will be approved if the review \nbody finds that one of the following approval criteria is met: \n1. Demolition of the resource has been evaluated against and, on balance, demolition \nhas been found to be equally or more supportive of relevant goals and policies of the \nComprehensive Plan, and any relevant area plans, than preservation, rehabilitation, or \nreuse of the resource. The evaluation must consider: \na. The resource’s age, condition, historic integrity, historic significance, design or \nconstruction rarity, value to the community, and association with historically \nmarginalized individuals or communities; \nb. The economic consequences for the owner and the community;  \nc. The merits of demolition; \nd. The merits of development that could replace the demolished resource, either as \nspecifically proposed for the site or as allowed under the existing zoning;  Chapter 33.846 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nHistoric Resource Reviews 10/1/24 \n \n846-22 \ne. The merits of preserving the resource, taking into consideration the purposes \ndescribed in Subsection A; and \nf. Any proposed mitigation for the demolition. \n2. The proposal is to demolish a contributing resource in a Conservation District or \nNational Register District, and demolition of the resource will be mitigated to \nenhance, preserve, or restore the archaeological, architectural, cultural, or historic \nsignificance or integrity of the district. The mitigation must be responsive to the \nsignificance and integrity of the resource proposed for demolition. The evaluation \nmust consider: \na. The resource’s age, condition, historic integrity, historic significance, design or \nconstruction rarity, value to the community, and association with historically \nmarginalized individuals or communities; \nb. The economic consequences for the owner and the community;  \nc. Relevant goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. \n3. The proposal is to demolish a contributing resource in a single-dwelling zone in a \nNational Register District, and demolition of the resource will facilitate the creation of \nmore deeply affordable dwelling units than could practicably result from preservation, \nrehabilitation, or reuse of the resource. In this case, deeply affordable means \npermanently affordable to those earning no more than 60 percent of the area median \nfamily income. The evaluation must consider:  \na. The resource’s age, condition, historic integrity, historic significance, design or \nconstruction rarity, value to the community, and association with historically \nmarginalized individuals or communities; \nb. The economic consequences for the owner and the community;  \nc. Relevant goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. \n4. The proposal is to demolish an accessory structure, and demolition of the resource \nwill not significantly diminish the architectural, cultural, or historic significance or \nintegrity of the associated landmark or district. \n \n(Added by: Ord.

Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.848 \n3/1/24 Impact Mitigation Plans \n \n848-1 \n33.848 Impact Mitigation Plans \n848 \n \nSections \n33.848.010 Purpose \n33.848.020 What is Covered by an Impact Mitigation Plan \n33.848.030 When an Impact Mitigation Plan is Required \n33.848.040 Procedure \n33.848.050 Approval Criteria \n33.848.060 Phases and Duration \n33.848.070 Impact Mitigation Plan Requirements \n33.848.080 Institution Closure or Relocation.  \n33.848.090 Implementation \n33.848.100 Amendment of an Impact Mitigation Plan \n33.848.010 Purpose \nThe Institutional Residential (IR) zone is intended to foster the growth of major institutions providing \neducational and medical services and employment to Portland’s residents. The IR zone was created \nin recognition of the valuable role these institutions play in the community. The new zone is \nintended to streamline the review process for the growth and expansion of these institutions. \nHowever, these institutions generally are in residential areas. In residential areas the level of public \nservices is scaled to a less intense level of development than is needed by these growing campuses. \nThese campuses are often of a radically different scale and character than the areas in which they \nare located. Development of a strategy for each campus for resolution of public service and \ncompatibility issues is important to the health of the institution and the City's neighborhoods. Once \nan institution has an approved impact mitigation plan, a conditional use master plan is not needed \nand will not be required. \n33.848.020 What is Covered by an Impact Mitigation Plan \nA. Present uses. An impact mitigation plan is for the entire area within the institutional \ncampus boundary. The impact mitigation plan is applicable to all uses and activities within \nthe boundary, regardless of the base zone, as long as the property is under the control of \nthe institution or institutions located on the campus. Control means the power to decide \nand direct the use of land, structures and other resources.  \nB. Future developments. The impact mitigation plan's provisions control the future growth of \nthe campus. The impact mitigation plan's provisions allow the expansion of existing \nfacilities and the development of new facilities after the expected impacts of the \ndevelopment have been mitigated. The impact mitigation plan focuses on impacts of future \ndevelopment or developments. The impact mitigation plan is specifically intended to not \nfocus on the characteristics of individual building projects. \n33.848.030 When an Impact Mitigation Plan is Required \nA. In an IR Zone. Development occurring in the IR zone in advance of the approval of an \nimpact mitigation plan is subject to the conditional use requirements of the IR zone unless \nthe institution has an approved master plan and the development is consistent with the \nmaster plan. When the institution has an approved master plan the institution may  Chapter 33.848 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nImpact Mitigation Plans 3/1/24 \n \n848-2 \ncontinue to develop in accordance with the master plan until such time as the master plan \nis due to be updated or until the institution desires a development that is not consistent \nwith the master plan. In the IR zone a master plan which is due to be updated, or which the \ninstitution wishes to amend, must be replaced by an impact mitigation plan, or by an \namended or new conditional use master plan. An institution can also choose to replace an \nexisting impact mitigation plan with a new conditional use master plan. An impact \nmitigation plan must be approved in accordance with the regulations of this Chapter. A \nconditional use master plan must be approved in accordance with the regulations of \nChapter 33.820. \nB. When required as part of another land use review. The review body as part of a land use \nreview, may require an impact mitigation plan when the facility has the potential for \ncreating significant impacts on nearby residential areas or on City infrastructure  \nor services.  \nC. Voluntarily. An applicant may also voluntarily submit an impact mitigation plan as part of a \nland use review.  \n33.848.040 Procedure \nA new impact mitigation plan is processed through a Type III procedure.  \n33.848.050 Approval Criteria \nThe approval criteria listed in this Section will be used to review impact mitigation plans. These \ncriteria correspond to the regulations governing the content of the Impact Mitigation Plan. The \napproval criteria are: \nA. The mission statement and impact mitigation plan contain the components required by the \nInstitutional Residential Zone (33.848.070). \nB. Mitigation. \n1. Each planned phase of development includes mitigation activities that offset impacts \nof that phase of development, except as provided in Paragraph B.2, below; \n2. Impacts that cannot be mitigated may be allowed if the public benefits of the \nproposed institutional campus boundary, mission statement, and impact mitigation \nplan outweigh the impacts. \nC. The proposed uses and possible future uses will be able to comply with all applicable \nrequirements of Title 33 and Title 32, Signs and Related Regulations, except where \nadjustments are being approved as part of the impact mitigation plan.  \nD. The proposed institutional zone boundary, mission statement, and impact mitigation plan \nhave been evaluated against the purpose of the IR Zone and on balance have been found \nto be supportive of the zone's characteristics as stated in Subsection 33.120.030.F. \nE. The proposal and impact mitigation plan are supportive of the Transportation Element of \nthe Comprehensive Plan. \n \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.848 \n3/1/24 Impact Mitigation Plans \n \n848-3 \nF. Transportation system: \n 1. The transportation system is capable of supporting the proposed use in addition to \nthe existing uses in the area. Evaluation factors include safety, capacity, level of \nservice, connectivity, transit availability, availability of pedestrian and bicycle \nnetworks, access restrictions, neighborhood impacts, impacts on pedestrian, bicycle, \nand transit circulation. Evaluation factors may be balanced; a finding of failure in one \nor more factors may be acceptable if the failure is not a result of the proposed \ndevelopment, and any additional impacts on the system from the proposed \ndevelopment are mitigated; \n2. Measures proportional to the impacts of the proposed use are proposed to mitigate \non- and off-site transportation impacts. Measures may include transportation \nimprovements to on-site circulation, public street dedication and improvement, \nprivate street improvements, intersection improvements, signal or other traffic \nmanagement improvements, additional transportation and parking demand \nmanagement actions, street crossing improvements, improvements to the local \npedestrian and bicycle networks, and transit improvements.  \n3. Transportation improvements adjacent to the development and in the vicinity needed \nto support the development are available or will be made available when the \ndevelopment is complete or, if the development is phased, will be available as each \nphase of the development is completed. \nG. Public services for water supply, police, fire, sanitary waste disposal and storm water \ndisposal are capable of serving the proposed development, or will be made capable by the \ntime the development is completed. \nH. City-designated significant resources such as views, landmarks, or habitat areas are \nprotected or enhanced. \nI. The appearance, location, and amount of commercial, non-institutional office, industrial \nservice, and manufacturing and production will not, by itself or in combination with other \nuses, decrease the desirability of adjacent residential areas for the retention of existing \nhousing or development of new housing. \nJ. The impact mitigation plan includes design, landscape, and multi-modal transportation \nplans which limits conflicts between the institutional campus and residential, commercial, \nand industrial uses located within the same neighborhood or neighborhoods as  \nthe campus. \nK. All relevant declarations of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions and any other relevant \nlegal instruments will be submitted in advance of any development. \nL. Campus institutional, commercial, office, industrial service, and industrial development \nwill, with mitigation, not have significant adverse impacts on the livability of nearby \nresidential and business areas. \nM. The impact mitigation plan adequately addresses potential nuisance-related impacts, such \nas litter, noise, shading, glare and traffic.  Chapter 33.848 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nImpact Mitigation Plans 3/1/24 \n \n848-4 \nN. The proposal is consistent with the policies and objectives of any plans applicable to the \ncampus's location which have been adopted by the City Council as part of the Portland's \nComprehensive Plan. \nO. The Portland Design Commission has reviewed and approved design guidelines or \nstandards that will ensure: \n1. An environment will be created which is attractive, safe, and pleasant for  \npedestrians; and \n2. The edges of the campus will provide smooth and attractive transitions between the \ninstitutional campus and adjacent residential and business areas. \n33.848.060 Phases and Duration \nAn impact mitigation plan remains in effect until all phases of development included in the plan \nhave been completed. An impact mitigation plan may include a specific expiration date. After all \nphases of development provided for in the impact mitigation plan have been completed, the plan \nremains in effect until it is amended, or updated, or superseded. \n33.848.070 Impact Mitigation Plan Requirements \nThe applicant must submit an impact mitigation plan which includes all the components listed in this \nSection. The review body may modify the proposal. While it is important to include adequate detail \nin the plan, the intent of this Chapter and the IR zone is to allow development of a document that \nguides the nature and timing of mitigation activity rather than one that specifies the nature, size, \nand location of all future development projects.  \nA. Mission statement and uses. An impact mitigation plan must include a mission statement. \nThe mission statement is intended to identify the scope of services and defines the range of \nuses and activities that the institution sees as ultimately occurring within the campus. The \nmission statement must include the following elements: \n1. A statement of the mission of the institution and the campus; \n2. A list of all the primary uses expected to occur on the campus with an explanation of \nthe interrelationship between each and the institutional campus mission; \n3. A list of all accessory uses expected to occur on the campus with an explanation of the \nrole each accessory activity plays in implementing the campus mission statement. \nExcept for Small Scale Energy Production, activities which provide goods or services to \npeople or facilities that are not on the campus may not be listed as  \naccessory activities; \n4. A list of temporary activities and events which are expected to occur on the campus in \ngeneral and at major event entertainment facilities located on the campus; \n5. A list of other retail sales and service, office and industrial activities expected on the \ncampus providing goods or services to people or facilities in the larger community, \nwith a statement for each explaining the interrelationship between the activity and \nthe campus mission statement; and \n6. The proposed locations for retail sales and service, office, industrial uses, and major \nevent entertainment facilities must be identified.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.848 \n3/1/24 Impact Mitigation Plans \n \n848-5 \nB. Institutional campus boundary. The Impact Mitigation Plan must delineate the ultimate \narea and boundaries of the institution’s campus. The proposed boundary may include land \nthat the institution does not presently control. However, sites must be controlled by the \ninstitution to be zoned IR. \nC. Location sensitive uses. The Impact Mitigation Plan must identify the location on the \ncampus where location sensitive uses are to be placed. Location sensitive uses are: \n1. Retail Sales And Service and Office uses which are not listed as primary or accessory \nuses in the mission statement; \n2. Any use or activity which provides goods or services to establishments not on  \nthe campus; \n3. Major Event Entertainment facilities permitted on the campus as conditional  \nuses; and \n4. Industrial Service and Manufacturing And Production uses permitted on the campus \nas conditional uses.  \nD. Phasing of mitigation activities. Impact mitigation measures and expected demands for \npublic services should be divided into phases of campus growth. Each phase of campus \ngrowth included in the impact mitigation plan must identify the specific mitigation activities \nwhich will be implemented in advance of the development activities included in that \ngrowth phase. A specific phase of campus growth may include several different \ndevelopment projects. Phases of growth may be described exclusively in terms of the \nmitigation measures to be implemented. Once the implementation measures for a phase of \ngrowth are in place any development project which is otherwise consistent with the \ncampus mission statement and the impact mitigation plan may be undertaken when the \nproject's expected impacts are at or below the levels mitigated for in the current phase of \ngrowth. Each phase of growth must identify mitigation measures to be taken to address the \nelements in Subsections E through I of this Section.  \nE. Waste disposal. For each phase of campus development, the following service loading \nmust be addressed: \n1. Effect on the City's sanitary sewer system; \n2. Capacity of the storm water disposal system that serves the campus; \n3. Disposal of hazardous solid waste, including preventing hazardous substances from \nentering the storm water disposal and sanitary sewer systems; and \n4. Preventing mud and other debris from campus construction sites from entering the \nstorm water disposal system. \n5. Reducing solid waste produced on the campus through recycling; \nF. Water supply. For each phase of campus development the following service loading must \nbe addressed: \n1. Water needs of the campus; and \n2. Water conservation activities and measures.  Chapter 33.848 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nImpact Mitigation Plans 3/1/24 \n \n848-6 \nG. Transportation. For each phase of campus development the following must be addressed \nin the multi-modal transportation plan. \n1. The location and amount of motor vehicle and bicycle parking; \n2. Strategies to reduce the number of motor vehicle miles traveled by those traveling to \nand from the campus, i.e. students, patients, faculty, staff, and visitors, including: \na. Measures to encourage those traveling to and from the campus to use \nalternatives to single-occupant auto trips (walking, bicycling, carpooling, and \npublic transit); \nb. The car or van pool programs; \nc. Incentives to be offered to employees and, where applicable, students, and \nothers to use public transit for travel to and from the campus;  \nd. Incentives to be offered to employees and, where applicable, students, and \nothers to travel on foot or by bicycle to and from the campus. This may include \nincentives for employees to live within walking distance of the campus; \n3. Planned improvements to the routes used by transit patrons between transit stops \nserving the campus and the campus’s circulation system for pedestrians and  \ntransit facilities; \n4. An on-site circulation system for all modes that meets the City’s connectivity \nstandards of no more than 530 feet apart for streets and no more than 330 feet apart \nfor pedestrian/bicycle connections where streets are not feasible, and links to \nadjacent streets and walkways; \n5. Traffic impacts on the streets in the vicinity of the campus and measures which will be \ntaken to ensure that the surrounding streets will function consistent with the \nTransportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan;  \n6. Parking mitigation, including an analysis of projected peak parking demand for daily \nactivities and events, and strategies to reduce the supply of parking without impacting \nnearby land uses; and \n7. To address adequacy of transportation services, a multi-modal impact study is \nrequired of the applicant by the Bureau of Transportation. In preparing such a study \nthe applicant should follow the guidelines set forth in the “Transportation Impact \nStudy Guidelines” document available from the Portland Bureau of Transportation.  \nH. Environmental, historic, scenic and open space. For each phase of campus development \nthe following must be addressed: \n1. A strategy for the protection and enhancement of environmental, scenic and historic \nresources which have been inventoried by the City, determined to be significant and \nare located within the land occupied by the campus; and \n2. A strategy for the enhancement of the campus's system of open spaces and their \nlinkage to public right-of-ways.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.848 \n3/1/24 Impact Mitigation Plans \n \n848-7 \nI. Neighborhood livability. For each phase of campus development the following must  \nbe addressed: \n1. Steps that will be taken to mitigate adverse impacts on the livability of nearby \nresidential neighborhoods and residential developments as well as non-institutionally \nowned properties within the institution campus boundary. Impacts include noise, \nodor, traffic, litter, parking, shading of adjacent areas, public safety, vibration  \nand glare; \n2. How the institution's development will accommodate continued provision of public \nservices including transportation, police, and fire protection to locations which are \nwithin the campus boundary but are not under the institution's control; \n3. A schedule for bringing the campus into compliance with all provisions of the zoning \ncode which may be practicably met as well as any conditions attached to the \nestablishment or expansion of the institutional campus or the approval of the campus \nimpact mitigation plan;  \n4. A plan showing how the campus will comply with the regulations for superblock if the \ncampus is subject to the superblock regulations. If the institution’s site includes more \nthan 50,000 square feet of vacated rights-of-way the institutional campus must meet \nthe development regulations for superblocks contained in Chapter 33.293; and \n5. Identification of distinct service or amenities the institution will provide for  \nnearby residents. \nJ. Neighborhood communication and coordination. The institutional campus must provide \nan ongoing process for communicating with neighbors. The process is to be implemented \nduring all phases of growth provided for by the impact mitigation plan. This process must \nprovide for the following: \n1. The institution must host a meeting, at least annually, with representatives from \nrecognized neighborhood and business associations within whose boundaries the \ninstitution is located. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss short term and long-\nrange plans for campus building and development.  \n2. A process for meeting with representatives of recognized neighborhood and business \nassociations within whose boundaries the institution is located, which provides for the \nfollowing:  \na. The periodic review of the institution's services and activities and potential \nexternal impacts; \nb. An opportunity to review and comment upon the design of specific development \nproposals planned in the current or next growth phase; and \nc. An opportunity to be informed of all land use reviews the institution is applying \nfor at least 30 days before they apply to the City. The institution must provide \ninformation on the types of activities, proposed size, and proposed location \nalong with any proposed mitigation plan measures.  Chapter 33.848 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nImpact Mitigation Plans 3/1/24 \n \n848-8 \nK. Design compatibility. The impact mitigation plan must include guidelines or standards that \nwill guide the design review process on the campus. The guidelines or standards must \ninclude the following elements: \n1. A set of design review guidelines and procedural thresholds to mitigate the potential \naesthetic impacts of large scale institutional development upon surrounding non-\ninstitutional development and public right-of-ways. For each specific development \nproject located near the campus boundaries or abutting a right-of-way, the applicant \nmust demonstrate compliance with these design guidelines prior to the granting of a \nbuilding permit. This will be processed through a Type II or a Type Ix design review \nprocedure at the completion of schematic design. A Type II procedure must be \nfollowed if the impact mitigation plan's design guidelines take the form of subjective \nor qualitative statements.

The development thresholds that trigger a Transportation Impact \nReview can be found in other chapters of this Title. Transportation Impact Review may be \ncompleted at various levels of detail. Generally, the more specific the proposal, the less review that \nwill be required as future development is built. Transportation Impact Review is intended as a \nmechanism to identify practicable actions to reduce and mitigate transportation impacts, consistent \nwith allowing those uses generally permitted or allowed in the base zone. \n33.852.100 Procedure \nTransportation Impact Reviews are processed through a Type II procedure.  \n33.852.105 Supplemental Application Requirements \nIn addition to the application requirements of Section 33.730.060, an application for Transportation \nImpact Review must include the following. In commercial/mixed use zones, if the applicant has \nchosen Transportation Impact Review rather than implementing the pre-approved plan allowed by \n33.266.410, only supplemental application requirement H is required. \nA. Description of proposed development. Transportation Impact Review must include \nproposed development, and may incorporate possible future development anticipated for \nup to ten years;  \nB. Delineation of the study area, and rationale for the delineation. At a minimum, the study \narea must include primary access routes between the site and the nearest regional \ntrafficways and major city traffic streets, regional transitways and major transit priority \nstreets, major city bikeways, and city walkways. Other secondary routes used to access the \nsite within the neighborhood(s) where the site is located must also be included; \nC. Description of existing uses and conditions in the study area. If the application is for \ndevelopment in the Cascade Station/Portland International Center Plan District, the \nfollowing are also required: \n1.

Transportation and parking demand management plan that has all the elements required \nby Chapter 17.107; and \nI. Evaluation of the transportation impacts of the proposed development, including impacts \nin the study area, on: \n1. Street function, capacity and level of service;  \n2. On-street parking; \n3. Access; \n4. Transit operations and movements; and \n5. Pedestrian and bicycle routes and safety. \n33.852.110 Approval Criteria for Transportation Impact Reviews \nThe request for development or development capacity will be approved if the review body finds that \nthe applicant has shown that all of the following criteria are met. In commercial/mixed use zones, if \nthe applicant has chosen Transportation Impact Review rather than implementing the pre-approved \nplan allowed by 33.266.410, only approval criterion B applies.  \nA. The transportation system is capable of supporting the recommended development in \naddition to the existing uses in the area. Evaluation factors include safety, street capacity, \nlevel of service, connectivity, transit availability, availability of pedestrian and bicycle \nnetworks, access restrictions, neighborhood impacts, impacts on pedestrian, bicycle, and \ntransit circulation. Evaluation factors may be balanced; a finding of failure in one or more \nfactors may be acceptable if the failure is not a result of the proposed development, and \nany additional impacts on the system from the proposed development are mitigated as \nrequired by criterion C; \nB. Proposed transportation and parking demand management actions are contributing to the \nCity sufficiently achieving the relevant mode share and residential auto ownership targets \nestablished by the Transportation System Plan for the uses and development on the site; \nC. Measures proportional to the impacts of the proposed development are proposed to \nmitigate on- and off-site transportation impacts. Measures may include transportation \nimprovements to on-site circulation, public street dedication and improvement, private \nstreet improvements, intersection improvements, signal or other traffic management \nimprovements, additional transportation and parking demand management actions, street  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.852 \n3/1/24 Transportation Impact Review \n  \n852-3 \ncrossing improvements, improvements to the local pedestrian and bicycle networks, and \ntransit improvements; and \nD.

Tree review also evaluates whether changes to tree preservation plans or tree-related \nconditions of approval are appropriate, and determines the appropriate mitigation for trees lost due \nto violations of tree regulations. The review allows flexibility for unusual situations and allows for \nthe purpose of the tree regulations to be met using creative or innovative methods. \n33.853.020 When Review Is Required \nTree review is required in the following situations: \nA. Scenic Overlay Zone, Johnson Creek Basin plan district, and Rocky Butte plan district. \nTrees that do not qualify for removal under the applicable overlay zone or plan district \nregulations listed below may be removed if approved through tree review:  \n1. The standards in the Scenic Overlay Zone in 33.480.040.B.2.h, Preservation of Trees; \n2. The standards in the Johnson Creek Basin plan district in 33.537.125, Tree Removal \nStandards; or  \n3. The standards in the Rocky Butte plan district in Subsection 33.570.040.C, Tree \nRemoval Standards.  \n4. Exception. Where the requested tree removal would also require environmental \nreview, only environmental review is required. \nB. Changing tree preservation requirements following land use approval.  \n1. Generally. Changes to tree preservation requirements approved as part of a land use \ndecision, including changes to trees to be preserved, mitigation requirements, or \nother requirements stated in conditions of approval, may be approved through  \ntree review.  \n2. Exceptions.  \na. If the tree preservation or mitigation was required as part of an environmental \nreview, Pleasant Valley resource review or greenway review, changes are subject \nto the regulations of the relevant overlay zone chapter and exempt from the \nregulations of this chapter.

The edges of the easement must be at least 15 feet from the edges of the \nstream, spring, seep, or wetland. The edges of a seep, spring, or wetland are \ndetermined through a wetland delineation, performed by an environmental scientist, \nand approved by PP&D. For seeps and springs, if one or more wetland characteristics \nare absent from the resource, the delineation will be based on the wetland \ncharacteristics present. The edges of a stream are defined as the top-of-bank. Where \nthe edge of the stream, spring, seep, or wetland is less than 15 feet from the edge of \nthe site, the easement boundary will be located along the edge of the site.   Chapter 33.854 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nPlanned Development Review 10/1/24 \n \n854-8 \n \n2. The following development, improvements, and activities are allowed in  \nthe easement: \na.

The \nchapter differentiates between amendments which are processed in a quasi-judicial manner and \nthose processed in a legislative manner. A discussion of quasi-judicial and legislative is found  \nin 33.700.070. \n33.855.020 Initiating a Zoning Map Amendment \nA. Quasi-Judicial. Requests for a zoning map amendment that are quasi-judicial may be \ninitiated by an individual, a representative of the owner, the Planning Commission, or the \nCity Council. The Historical Landmarks Commission may initiate amendments concerning \nhistoric districts. The Director of PP&D may request amendments for initiation by the \nPlanning Commission. Initiations by a review body are made without prejudice towards the \noutcome. \nB. Legislative. Requests for zoning map amendments that are legislative may be initiated by \nthe Planning Commission or the City Council. The Design Commission may initiate \namendments concerning design districts. Others may request to the Planning Commission \nto initiate a legislative zoning map amendment. The Planning Commission will review these \namendment requests against adopted initiation criteria. Initiations by a review body are \nmade without prejudice towards the outcome. \n33.855.030 When a Comprehensive Plan Map Amendment Is Also Required \nZoning map amendments may also require an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan Map. \nDetermination of whether the Comprehensive Plan Map must also be amended is based upon \nwhether the proposed zoning map amendment is to a zone designated by the Comprehensive Plan \nMap. See Policy 1.18 in the Comprehensive Plan. If an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan Map \nis required, the zoning map amendment cannot be made unless the amendment to the \nComprehensive Plan Map is approved first. Both amendments may be processed concurrently.  Chapter 33.855 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nZoning Map Amendments  3/1/22 \n \n855-2 \n33.855.040 Procedure \nA. Quasi-Judicial. Requests for quasi-judicial zoning map amendments are reviewed through a \nType II or Type III procedure. Zoning map amendments to rezone a site to IR, Institutional \nResidential, are processed through a Type II procedure. Amendments for all other zones \nare processed through a Type III procedure.  \nB. Legislative. Requests for legislative zoning map amendments are reviewed through the \nlegislative procedure stated in Chapter 33.740. \nC. Manufactured dwelling park special notice. The applicant for a zoning map amendment \nthat changes the zoning on a manufactured dwelling park must provide written notice by \nfirst class mail to each unit in the manufactured dwelling park. The notice must include the \ntime, date, and location of the public hearing and the new zone being proposed. The \nnotices must be mailed 20 to 40 days before the hearing date. \n33.855.050 Approval Criteria for Base Zone Changes \nAn amendment to the base zone designation on the Official Zoning Maps will be approved (either \nquasi-judicial or legislative) if the review body finds that the applicant has shown that all of the \nfollowing approval criteria are met: \nA. Compliance with the Comprehensive Plan Map. The zone change is to a corresponding \nzone of the Comprehensive Plan Map. When the Comprehensive Plan Map designation has \nmore than one corresponding zone, it must be shown that the proposed zone is the most \nappropriate, taking into consideration the purposes or characteristics of each zone and the \nzoning pattern of surrounding land. \nB. Adequate public services.  \n1. Adequacy of services applies only to the specific zone change site. \n2. Adequacy of services is determined based on performance standards established by \nthe service bureaus. The burden of proof is on the applicant to provide the necessary \nanalysis. Factors to consider include the projected service demands of the site, the \nability of the existing and proposed public services to accommodate those demand \nnumbers, and the characteristics of the site and development proposal, if any.  \na. Public services for water supply, and capacity, and police and fire protection are \ncapable of supporting the uses allowed by the zone or will be capable by the time \ndevelopment is complete.  \nb. Proposed sanitary waste disposal and stormwater disposal systems are or will be \nmade acceptable to the Bureau of Environmental Services. Performance \nstandards must be applied to the specific site design. Limitations on \ndevelopment level, mitigation measures or discharge restrictions may be \nnecessary in order to assure these services are adequate. \nc. Public services for transportation system facilities are capable of supporting the \nuses allowed by the zone or will be capable by the time development is \ncomplete. Transportation capacity must be capable of supporting the uses \nallowed by the zone by the time development is complete, and in the planning  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.855 \n3/1/22 Zoning Map Amendments \n \n855-3 \nperiod defined by the Oregon Transportation Rule, which is 20 years from the \ndate the Transportation System Plan was adopted. Limitations on development \nlevel or mitigation measures may be necessary in order to assure transportation \nservices are adequate.  \nd. The school district within which the site is located has adequate enrollment \ncapacity to accommodate any projected increase in student population over the \nnumber that would result from development in the existing zone. This criterion \napplies only to sites that are within a school district that has an adopted school \nfacility plan that has been acknowledged by the City of Portland. \n3. Services to a site that is requesting rezoning to IR Institutional Residential, will be \nconsidered adequate if the development proposed is mitigated through an approved \nimpact mitigation plan or conditional use master plan for the institution. \nC. When the requested zone is IR, Institutional Residential. In addition to the criteria listed in \nsubsections A. and B. of this Section, a site being rezoned to IR, Institutional Residential \nmust be under the control of an institution that is a participant in an approved impact \nmitigation plan or conditional use master plan that includes the site. A site will be \nconsidered under an institution's control when it is owned by the institution or when the \ninstitution holds a lease for use of the site that covers the next 20 years or more. \nD. When the requested zone change is CI1 or CI2. When the requested zone change is CI1 or \nCI2, a Transportation Impact Review is required as part of the zoning map amendment. \nE. Location. The site must be within the City’s boundary of incorporation.  \nSee Section 33.855.080. \n33.855.060 Approval Criteria for Other Changes \nIn addition to the base zones and Comprehensive Plan designations, the Official Zoning Maps also \nshow overlay zones, plan districts, and other items such as special setback lines, recreational trails, \nscenic viewpoints, and historic resources. Amendments to all of these except historic resources and \nthe creation of plan districts are reviewed against the approval criteria stated in this section. Historic \nresources are reviewed as stated in Chapter 33.846, Historic Resource Reviews. The creation of a \nnew plan district is subject to the approval criteria stated in 33.500.050. An amendment will be \napproved (either quasi-judicial or legislative) if the review body finds that all of the following \napproval criteria are met:  \nA. Where a designation is proposed to be added, the designation must be shown to be \nneeded to address a specific situation. When a designation is proposed to be removed, it \nmust be shown that the reason for applying the designation no longer exists or has been \naddressed through other means;  \nB. The addition or removal is consistent with the purpose and adoption criteria of the \nregulation and any applicable goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan and any area \nplans; and \nC. In the Marquam Hill plan district, relocation of a scenic viewpoint must be shown to result \nin a net benefit to the public, taking into consideration such factors as public access, the \nquality of the view, the breadth of the view, and the public amenities that are or will  \nbe available.  Chapter 33.855 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nZoning Map Amendments  3/1/22 \n \n855-4 \n33.855.070 Corrections to the Official Zoning Maps \nThe Director of PP&D may initiate and approve a review following the Type II procedure for the \ntypes of discretionary corrections to the Official Zoning Maps listed below. Nondiscretionary \ncorrections to the Official Zoning Maps may be initiated by the Director of Planning and \nSustainability as described in Section 1.01.037 of the Portland City Code. \nA. Mapping errors. The correction may be made for mapping errors such as: \n1. A map line that was intended to follow a topographical feature does not do so. \nTopographical features include the tops and bottoms of hillsides, the banks of water \nbodies, and center lines of creeks or drainage ditches; or \n2. There is a discrepancy between maps and on balance there is sufficient evidence of \nlegislative intent for where the line should be located. \nB. Movement of the reference item for the map line. The correction may be made when it \ncan be clearly shown that a map line is based on the location of a reference item that has \nsince been moved. Reference items are rights-of-way, tentative rights-of-way, utility \neasements and similar type items. Map line changes in these cases must not be more than \na trivial change to the map pattern and must not result in any significant impacts to \nabutting lots. \nC. Land within the Urban Growth Boundary. The correction may be made when it involves \nthe removal of the Future Urban overlay zone from properties that are now within the \nUrban Growth Boundary. \n33.855.075 Automatic Map Amendments for Historic Resources \nThe Official Zoning Maps will be amended automatically to add or remove historic resources  \nas follows: \nA. Resources listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  \n1. When a historic resource is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is \nautomatically identified on the Official Zoning Maps as follows: \na. Historic resources listed on the National Register of Historic Places on or before \nJanuary 27, 2017 are automatically identified on the Official Zoning Maps as a \nHistoric Landmark or Historic District on the date the Bureau of Planning and \nSustainability receives notification from the State Historic Preservation Office of \nthe listing of the resource on the National Register; and \nb. Historic resources listed on the National Register of Historic Places after January \n27, 2017 are automatically identified on the Official Zoning Maps as a National \nRegister Landmark or National Register District on the date the Bureau of \nPlanning and Sustainability receives notification from the State Historic \nPreservation Office of the listing of the resource on the National Register. \n2. When a historic resource is removed from the National Register of Historic Places and \nit has not also been independently designated by the City as the result of a legislative \nor quasi-judicial procedure, it is automatically removed from the Official Zoning Maps \nas a Historic Landmark, Historic District, National Register Landmark, or National  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.855 \n3/1/22 Zoning Map Amendments \n \n855-5 \nRegister District on the date the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability receives \nnotification from the State Historic Preservation Office of the removal of the resource \nfrom the National Register. \n3. When the federal Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places approves a change \nto the boundary of a historic resource listed on the National Register of Historic Places \nthat has not also been independently designated by the City as the result of a \nlegislative or quasi-judicial procedure, the change is automatically identified on the \nOfficial Zoning Map on the date the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability receives \nnotification from the State Historic Preservation Office of the change.   \nB. Removal after destruction. If a Historic Landmark, Conservation Landmark, or National \nRegister Landmark is destroyed by causes beyond the control of the owner, the Landmark \ndesignation for the resource is automatically removed from the Official Zoning Maps. \nC. Removal after demolition. If a Historic Landmark, Conservation Landmark, or National \nRegister Landmark is demolished after approval of demolition through demolition review, \nthe Landmark designation for the resource is automatically removed from the Official  \nZoning Maps. \nD. Removal after relocation. If a Historic Landmark, Conservation Landmark, or National \nRegister Landmark is relocated, the Landmark designation for the resource is automatically \nremoved from the sending site on the Official Zoning Maps. \n33.855.080 Automatic Zone Map Amendments for Annexed Areas \nA. Areas with Multnomah County zoning. Areas annexed into the City from Multnomah \nCounty with Multnomah County zoning automatically receive comparable City zoning upon \nofficially being incorporated into the City. Comparable zoning is shown in Table 855-1 and \nwill apply to the area unless it is superseded by a special area study or a plan district. \nB. Areas with City zoning. In areas annexed into the City from Multnomah County that \nalready have City zoning and Comprehensive Plan designations, zoning is automatically \nchanged to conform with the Comprehensive Plan designation when the site is officially \nincorporated into the City. \n  Chapter 33.855 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nZoning Map Amendments  3/1/22 \n \n855-6 \n \nTable 855-1 \nAssigned City Zoning for Multnomah County Zones \nMultnomah County Zones Assigned City Zoning \nBase zones \nAreas with farm or residential zoning \noutside the UGB \nFR + f \nAreas with commercial zoning \noutside the UGB \nCM1 \nCFU, F2, MUA-20, RR, SR, LR-40, R-\n40,  LR-30, R-30, MUF-19, MUF-38 \nRF [1] \nUF-10, UF-20 inside the UGB [2] \nRC inside the UGB CM1 \nLR-20, R-20 R20 \nLR-10, R-10 R10 \nLR-7, R7 R7 \nLR-7.5 R7 + Glendoveer Plan District \nLR-5 R5 \nMR-4, MR-3 RM1 [3] \nHR-2, A-2 RM1 [3] \nHR-1, A1B RM2 [3] \nBPO CM2 \nLC, C4, SC CM1 \nGC, EC, C2, NC, C3 CE \nLM, M3, M4 EG1 \nGm, M2 IG2 \nHM, M1 IH \nTHR RM3 \nTMR RM1 [3] \nTLR-5 R5 \nTLC CM1 \nTNC CM2 \nTGC CM2 \nTO CM2 \nTLM EG1 \nOverlay zones \nSEC p, c [4] \nFH, FF, FW not mapped; handled by Portland Permitting & Develoment \nNI x \nPD, RPD Not mapped; becomes an approved PUD \nOP Not mapped \nCS If open space, then OS base zone; just the base zone \notherwise \nHP d \nLF h \nWRG g, r, i, n [4] \n \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.855 \n3/1/22 Zoning Map Amendments \n \n855-7 \nNotes: \n[1] The designation will be RF unless this land is in an approved subdivision at a density higher than \nRF or has been preplanned by an adopted City plan, in which case a higher density zone may be \napplied. \n[2] Reviewed through a quasi-judicial review; initiated by the Director of PP&D. \n[3] Sites with a documented, approved office are CM1.

In the case of a violation, the impact \nevaluation is used to determine the nature and scope of the significant detrimental \nimpacts. \na. An impact evaluation includes: \n(1) Identification, by characteristic and quantity, of the natural resources and \ntheir functional values found on the site. The Willamette River Central Reach \nNatural Resources Protection Plan (2018) and River Plan / South Reach \nNatural Resources Protection Plan (2020) provide site-specific information \non the natural resource features including: \n• open water; \n• shallow water (river depth 0-20 feet); \n• beach; \n• riparian vegetation; \n• upland and bottomland forest; \n• grassland; \n• flood area and floodplain; \n• wetlands, streams and ponds; and \n• special habitat area. \n \nThe Willamette River Central Reach Natural Resources Protection Plan \n(2018) and River Plan / South Reach Natural Resources Protection Plan \n(2020) provide site-specific information on the functional values provided by \nthe various natural resource features including: \n• Microclimate and shade; \n• Stream flow moderation and water storage; \n• Bank function, and sediment, pollution and nutrient control; \n• Large wood and channel dynamics; \n• Organic inputs, food web and nutrient cycling; \n• Fish and wildlife habitat; and \n• Habitat connectivity/movement corridor. \n \nThe Willamette River Central Reach Natural Resources Protection Plan \n(2018) and River Plan / South Reach Natural Resources Protection Plan \n(2020) also provide information on wildlife and plant special status species \nthat are known or reasonably expected to occur within or use a site. The \napplication must contain current information regarding any special status \nspecies known or expected to occur on the site; \n(2)  Identification and description of the scenic resources on the site. Scenic \nresources are mapped on the official zoning maps with the Scenic overlay  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.865 \n3/1/24 River Review \n865-7 \nzone and are described in the Central City Scenic Resources Protection Plan \n(2018) and River Plan / South Reach Scenic Resources Protection Plan (2020); \n(3) Identification of significant unavoidable detrimental impacts on identified \nnatural and scenic resources and functional values. Actions that could cause \ndetrimental impacts and should be identified include: \n• excavation and fill both in the water and above the ordinary high water \nmark.  The quality and source of fill material is an important factor to be \nconsidered;  \n• clearing and grading; \n• construction; \n• vegetation removal; \n• tree planting; \n• altering bathymetry; \n• altering a vegetated riparian corridor or upland vegetated area; \n• altering the floodplain; and \n• altering the temperature of the river especially the altering of existing \ncold water sources. \n(4) Evaluation of practicable alternative locations, design modifications, or \nalternative methods of development that both achieve the project purpose, \ntaking into account cost and technology, and minimize significant \ndetrimental impacts on identified natural and scenic resources and \nfunctional values; and \n(5) Determination of the practicable alternative that best meets the applicable \napproval criteria. \nb. An impact evaluation for a violation includes: \n(1) Description, by characteristics and quantity, of the natural and scenic \nresources and functional values on the site prior to the violation; and \n(2) Determination of the impact of the violation on the natural and scenic \nresources and functional values. \n2. Biological assessment. A biological assessment developed for the purposes of a federal \nor state permit may be submitted in place of some or all of the impact evaluation if \nthe biological assessment includes the information described in subparagraph B.1, \nabove. In the event that the applicant submits a biological assessment in place of \nsome or all of the impact evaluation, the applicant must identify which aspects of the \nimpact evaluation are covered by the biological assessment and, if necessary, identify \nwhich pieces of information will be included in the impact evaluation. \n3. Supplemental environmental site assessment. A site-specific environmental \nassessment, prepared by a qualified consultant, to more precisely determine the \nexistence, location, type, extent, and quality of the natural resources and functions on \nthe site can be provided as part of the supplemental narrative. The assessment may \nverify, supplement, or challenge the information in the City's inventory for the \npurpose of informing the impact evaluation and identifying mitigation obligations;  Chapter 33.865 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Review  3/1/24 \n865-8 \n4. Construction management plan. Identify measures that will be taken during \nconstruction or remediation to protect the remaining natural and scenic resources and \nfunctional values at and near the construction site and provide a description of how \nareas that are not affected by the construction will be protected. For example, \ndescribe how trees will be protected, erosion controlled, construction equipment \ncontrolled, and the timing of construction; and \n5. Mitigation or remediation plan. The purpose of a mitigation or remediation plan is to \ncompensate for unavoidable significant detrimental impacts on identified natural and \nscenic resources and functional values that result from the chosen development \nalternative or violation. A mitigation or remediation plan includes: \na. Natural or scenic resources and functional values to be restored, created, or \nenhanced within mitigation or remediation area; \nb. Documentation of coordination with appropriate local, regional, special district, \nstate, and federal regulatory agencies; \nc. Construction timetables; \nd. Operation and long-term maintenance plan;  \ne. Monitoring and evaluation procedures that include periodic reporting; \nf. Remedial actions for unsuccessful mitigation;  \ng. Information showing compliance with Section 33.248.090, Mitigation and \nRestoration Plantings;  \nh. If off-site mitigation is proposed, demonstration that on-site mitigation is not \npracticable or ecologically beneficial; and \ni.  If mitigation bank credits will be used, proof of purchase from a City-approved \nmitigation bank. \n33.865.100 Approval Criteria.   \nRequests for a River Review will be approved if the review body finds that the applicant has shown \nthat all applicable approval criteria have been met.   \nA. Development within the River Environmental overlay zone.  The applicant's supplemental \nnarrative must demonstrate that all of the following are met: \n1. Land divisions, Property Line Adjustments, and Planned Developments: \na. Except for river-dependent and river-related uses and development, proposed \nuses and development must be outside the combined flood hazard area except \nas provided under Subparagraph A.1.d. Other areas of the combined flood \nhazard area must be in environmental resource tracts; \nb. There are no practicable arrangements for the proposed lots, tracts, roads, or \nparcels within the same site, that would allow for the provision of significantly \nmore of the building sites, vehicular access, utility service areas, and other \ndevelopment on lands outside the River Environmental overlay zone;  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.865 \n3/1/24 River Review \n865-9 \nc. Development, including building sites, vehicular access and utilities, within the \nRiver Environmental overlay zone must have the least amount of detrimental \nimpact on identified resources and functional values as is practicable. \nSignificantly different but practicable development alternatives, including \nalternative housing types or a reduction in the number of proposed or required \nunits or lots, may be required if the alternative will have less impact on the \nidentified resources and functional values than the proposed development; \nd. River-dependent and river -related development, rights-of-way, driveways, \nwalkways, outfalls, and utilities; \n(1) The location, design, and construction method of any outfall or utility \nproposed within the River Environmental overlay zone has the least \nsignificant detrimental impact to the identified resources and functional \nvalues of other practicable alternatives including alternatives outside the \nRiver Environmental overlay zone; \n(2) There will be no significant detrimental impact on water bodies for the \nmigration, rearing, feeding, or spawning of fish; and \n(3) Water bodies are crossed only when there are no practicable alternatives \nwith fewer significant detrimental impacts; and \ne. Mitigation: \n(1) The mitigation plan demonstrates that all significant detrimental impacts on \nidentified scenic and natural resources and functional values, and the \ninterim loss of functional value will be compensated for. In addition, for \nproposed development within the riparian buffer area that is not river-\ndependent or river-related, the mitigation plan must result in a significant \nimprovement of at least one of the following functional values: bank \nfunction and control of sediments, nutrients and pollutants, or large wood \nand channel dynamics; \n(2) The amount of natural resource mitigation due as compensation is based on \nthe amount and relative condition of the resources and functional values \nimpacted by the proposal. The amount of natural resource mitigation \nrequired will be at a ratio of no less than 1.5:1 (mitigation area to project \ndisturbance area) for on-site mitigation or mitigation bank credits and no \nless than 3:1 for offsite mitigation but may be more to address the \nfollowing: \n• The uniqueness of the resources and functional values impacted;  \n• The relative condition of the mitigation area; \n• The distance between the impact area and mitigation area; and  \n• The time lag between when the resources and functional values are lost \ndue to the impacts and the point when the mitigation site will achieve \nfull functions;  \n(3) To the extent practicable, the natural and scenic resources and functional \nvalues restored or enhanced as mitigation must be the same kind of  Chapter 33.865 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Review  3/1/24 \n865-10 \nresource, performing the same functions as the lost resource. In addition, \nthe mitigation plan must demonstrate that mitigation for tree removal in \nthe combined flood hazard area must meet or exceed the replacement \nrequirements of Table 475-2 and occur within the combined flood hazard \narea;  \n(4) Mitigation must occur on-site in the River Environmental overlay zone, or an \narea that is contiguous to the River Environmental overlay zone, when \npracticable and ecologically beneficial. Factors to be considered when \nevaluating this criterion include: \n• The potential for the long-term success of the restored resources and \nfunctional values in the mitigation area; \n• The amount, size, shape, and connectivity potential of on-site mitigation \nareas;  \n• The location of the mitigation area in relation to existing, proposed or \nfuture development on the site, and the impact development may have \non the mitigation area; \n• Contamination; and  \n• Any other site-specific issue or constraint;    \n(5) If on-site mitigation is not practicable or ecologically beneficial, then off-site \nmitigation is allowed as follows: \n• Through the purchase of credits from a city approved mitigation bank \nlocated along the Lower Willamette River as close as possible to the \ndisturbance area; \n• Through offsite mitigation in the River Environmental overlay zone. If \nthe offsite mitigation compensates for significant detrimental impacts \nlocated within the combined flood hazard area, then the offsite \nmitigation area must also be located within the combined flood hazard \narea. The applicant must own the area where the mitigation will occur \nor possess a legal instrument that is approved by the City as sufficient to \ncarry out and ensure the success of the mitigation plan (such as an \neasement or deed restriction); \n(6) In cases where the proposed development is subject to mitigation as the \nresult of obtaining permits from the Oregon Department of State Lands or \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the mitigation required for those permits \ncan count toward meeting this mitigation requirement as long as that \nmitigation is found to adequately compensate for impacts to the identified \nnatural resources and functional values; and  \n(7) The operation and long-term maintenance plan ensures the ongoing \nmaintenance and protection of the mitigation or remediation areas and \nassociated resources and functional values. Plants that die must be replaced \nin kind. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the mitigation or remediation \narea must occur and monitoring reports must be submitted to Portland \nPermitting & Development annually for up to 5 years based on scope and \nsize of the mitigation or remediation area.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.865 \n3/1/24 River Review \n865-11 \n2. Resource enhancement and mitigation bank projects: \na. There will be no net loss of total resource area; \nb. There will be no net loss of functional values;  \nc. There will be a significant improvement of at least one functional value; and \nd. For mitigation banks, the applicant must possess a legal instrument, such as a \nconservation easement or deed restriction, that is approved by the City as \nsufficient to ensure the right to carry out, monitor and maintain the mitigation. \n3. All other proposals in the River Environmental overlay zone: \na. Proposed development minimizes the loss of identified natural or scenic \nresources and functional values consistent with the uses that are generally \npermitted or allowed in the base zone without a land use review, or permitted or \nallowed by an approved conditional use review; \nb. Proposed development locations, designs, and construction methods are less \ndetrimental to identified natural and scenic resources and functional values than \nother practicable and significantly different alternatives, including alternatives on \nthe same site but outside of the River Environmental overlay zone; \nc. There will be no significant detrimental impact on areas of the site reserved for \nmitigation, areas within the River Environmental overlay zone not proposed for \ndevelopment at this time, downstream river habitat, or other sites where \nenvironmental restoration is in progress or complete;   \nd. Mitigation: \n(1) The mitigation plan demonstrates that all significant detrimental impacts on \nidentified scenic and natural resources and functional values, and the \ninterim loss of functional value will be compensated for. In addition, for \nproposed development within the riparian buffer area that is not river-\ndependent or river-related, the mitigation plan must result in a significant \nimprovement of at least one of the following riparian functions: bank \nfunction and control of sediments, nutrients and pollutants, or large wood \nand channel dynamics  \n(2) The amount of natural resource mitigation due as compensation is based on \nthe amount and relative condition of the resources and functional values \nimpacted by the proposal. The amount of natural resource mitigation \nrequired will be at a ratio of no less than 1.5:1 (mitigation area to project \ndisturbance area) for on-site mitigation or mitigation bank credits and no \nless than 3:1 for offsite mitigation but may be more to address the \nfollowing: \n• The uniqueness of the resources and functional values impacted;  \n• The relative condition of the mitigation area; \n• The distance between the impact area and mitigation area; and   Chapter 33.865 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Review  3/1/24 \n865-12 \n• The time lag between when the resources and functional values are lost \ndue to the impacts and the point when the mitigation site will achieve \nfull functions;  \n(3) To the extent practicable, the natural and scenic resources and functional \nvalues restored or enhanced as mitigation must be the same kind of \nresource, performing the same functions as the lost resource.

Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the mitigation or remediation \narea must occur and monitoring reports must be submitted to Portland \nPermitting & Development annually for up to 5 years based on scope and \nsize of the mitigation or remediation area. \nB. Modification of River Environmental overlay zone boundaries. Modifications of River \nEnvironmental overlay zone boundaries that reflect permitted changes in the location or \nquality of resource areas will be approved upon finding that the applicant's statement \ndemonstrates that either Paragraph B.1 or B.2 are met. For modification of River \nEnvironmental zone boundaries based on a more detailed site specific environmental study \nthat confirms the location of natural resource features identified in the adopted Natural \nResources Inventory, the applicant's impact evaluation must demonstrate that Paragraph \nB.3 is met: \n1. Successful mitigation. An approved mitigation plan has been successful and a new, \nrestored, or enhanced resource exists which should be included in the River \nEnvironmental overlay zone; or \n2. Approved loss of resource area. All of the following must be met: \na. All approved development in a resource area has been completed; \nb. All mitigation required of this development has been successful; and \nc. The identified resources and functional values at the developed site no longer \nexist, or have been subject to a significant detrimental impact. \n3. Modification of River Environmental overlay zone boundaries based on a more \ndetailed site-specific environmental study. The River Environmental overlay zone line \nlocation may be modified to more accurately reflect the location of natural resources \nand functional values on the site. All of the following must be met: \na. The modified River Environmental overlay zone boundary must include all \nnatural resource features that receive a high or medium rank using the \nmethodology within the adopted Natural Resources Inventory;  \nb. The modified River Environmental overlay zone boundary must include:  \n(1) Within the Willamette River Central Reach, all land within and riverward of \n50 feet from the top of bank of a river, stream, drainageway, wetland or \nother water body.  \n(2) Within the Willamette River South Reach, all land within and riverward of \n100 feet from the top of bank of a river, stream, drainageway, wetland or \nother water body; and \nc. The modified River Environmental overlay zone boundary must include the \nriparian buffer area shown on Map 475-6. \n33.865.110 Modifications of Site-Related Development Standards   \nThe review body may consider modifications to site-related development standards that are not \notherwise prohibited from being adjusted as part of the River Review process. These modifications \nare done as part of the River Review process and are not required to go through the adjustment  Chapter 33.865 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nRiver Review  3/1/24 \n865-14 \nprocess.  Adjustments to use-related development standards (such as floor-area ratios, intensity of \nuse, size of the use or concentration of uses) are subject to the adjustment process of Chapter \n33.805. In order to approve these modifications, the review body must find that the development \nwill result in greater protection of the resources and functional values identified on the site and will, \non balance, be consistent with the purpose of the applicable regulations. \n33.865.120 Corrections to violations of the River Environmental Overlay Zone Regulations \nFor corrections to violations of the River Environmental development standards the application \nmust meet all applicable approval criteria stated in Subsection 33.865.100.A and all of the approval \ncriteria listed below in Subsections A through D except the criterion in Paragraph C.1. If these \ncriteria cannot be met, then the applicant’s remediation plan must demonstrate that all of the \nfollowing are met: \nA. The remediation is done in the same area as the violation; and \nB. A second area, equal in size to the area disturbed by the violation activity, must also be \nreplanted to meet the standards of Table 475-3. \nC. The remediation plan demonstrates that after its implementation there will be: \n1. No permanent loss of any type of resource or functional values; \n2. A significant improvement of a least one functional value; and  \n3. There will be minimal loss of resources and functional values during remediation until \nthe full remediation program is established. \nD. The operation and long-term maintenance plan ensures the ongoing maintenance and \nprotection of the remediation area and associated resources and functional values. Plants \nthat die must be replaced in kind. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the remediation \narea must occur and monitoring reports must be submitted to Portland Permitting & \nDevelopment annually for up to 5 years based on scope and size of the remediation area. \n33.865.200 Performance Guarantees  \nThe Director of PP&D may require performance guarantees as a condition of approval to ensure \nmitigation or remediation.  See Section 33.700.050, Performance Guarantees. \n33.865.210 Special Evaluation by a Professional \nA professional consultant may be hired to evaluate proposals and make recommendations if the \nDirector of PP&D finds that outside expertise is needed due to exceptional circumstances. The \nprofessional will have expertise in the specific resource or functional value or in the potential \nadverse impacts on the resource or functional value. A fee for these services will be charged to the \napplicant in addition to the application fee. \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.865 \n3/1/24 River Review \n865-15 \nChanges to an Approved River Review \n33.865.300 When a River Review Can be Changed \nRiver review can be changed as allowed below if: \nA.

Characteristics include the type and amount of \nactivity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and certain \nsite factors. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assignment of present and future uses \nto zones. The decision to allow or prohibit the use categories in the various zones is based on the \ngoals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. \n33.920.020 Category Titles \nThe names of the use categories start with capital letters throughout this Title. \n33.920.030 Classification of Uses \nA. Considerations. \n1. Uses are assigned to the category whose description most closely describes the nature \nof the primary use. The \"Characteristics\" subsection of each use category describes \nthe characteristics of each use category. Developments may have more than one \nprimary use. Developments may also have one or more accessory uses. Developments \nwith more than one primary use are addressed in Subsection B. below. Accessory uses \nare addressed in Subsection C. below. \n2. The following items are considered to determine what use category the use is in, and \nwhether the activities constitute primary uses or accessory uses: \n• The description of the activity(ies) in relationship to the characteristics of each \nuse category; \n• The relative amount of site or floor space and equipment devoted to  \nthe activity; \n• Relative amounts of sales from each activity;  \n• The customer type for each activity; \n• The relative number of employees in each activity; \n• Hours of operation; \n• Building and site arrangement; \n• Vehicles used with the activity; \n• The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the activity; \n• Signs; \n• How the use advertises itself; and \n• Whether the activity would be likely to be found independent of the other \nactivities on the site. \nB. Developments with multiple primary uses. When all the primary uses of a development \nfall within one use category, then the development is assigned to that use category. For \nexample, a development that contains a retail bakery and a cafe would be classified in the \nRetail Sales And Service category because all the primary uses are in that category. When \nthe primary uses of a development fall within different use categories, each primary use is \nclassified in the applicable category and is subject to the regulations for that category.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.920 \n10/1/24 Description of Use Categories \n \n920-3 \n \nC. Accessory uses. Accessory uses are allowed by right in conjunction with the use unless \nstated otherwise in the regulations. Also, unless otherwise stated, they are subject to the \nsame regulations as the primary use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples with \nthe categories. \nD. Use of examples. The \"Examples\" subsection of each use category provides a list of \nexamples of uses that are included in the use category. The names of uses on the lists are \ngeneric. They are based on the common meaning of the terms and not on what a specific \nuse may call itself. For example, a use whose business name is \"Wholesale Liquidation\" but \nthat sells mostly to consumers, would be included in the Retail Sales And Service category \nrather than the Wholesale Sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site \nmatches the description of the Retail Sales And Service category. \nResidential Use Categories \n33.920.100 Group Living \nA. Characteristics. Group Living is the residential occupancy of a dwelling unit that contains \nmore than eight bedrooms. Group Living is also the residential occupancy of a congregate \nhousing facility. Tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month basis, or for a longer period. \nUses where tenancy may be arranged for a shorter period are not considered residential. \nThey are considered to be a form of transient lodging (see the Retail Sales And Service and \nCommunity Service categories). Generally, Group Living uses often include a common \neating area for residents. The residents may or may not receive any combination of care, \ntraining, or treatment, as long as they also reside at the site. Group Living may include the \nState definition of residential facility (see Chapter 33.910, Definitions). \nB. Accessory Uses.

Minimum requirements. Minimum requirements other than density are calculated as \ndescribed in Paragraph A.1. Minimum requirements for density are calculated as described \nin Paragraph A.2. \n1. Generally. When a regulation is expressed in terms of a minimum requirement, any \nfractional result will be rounded up to the next consecutive whole number. For \nexample, if a minimum requirement of one tree for every 30 feet is applied to a 50 \nfoot strip, the resulting fraction of 1.67 is rounded up to 2 required trees. \n2. Density. Minimum density calculations are rounded based on a fraction that is \ntruncated to two numbers past the decimal point. For example, 3.4289 is truncated to \n3.42. Where a minimum density calculation results in a fraction that is .50 or above, \nthe fraction is rounded up to the next whole number. Where a minimum density \ncalculation results in a fraction that is less than .50, the fraction is rounded down to \nthe preceding whole number. \nB. Maximum limits. Maximum limits other than density are calculated as described in \nParagraph B.1. Maximum limits for density are calculated as described in Paragraph B.2.  Chapter 33.930 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMeasurements 8/1/21 \n \n930-2 \n1. Generally. When a regulation is expressed in terms of maximum limits, any fractional \nresult will be rounded down to the preceding whole number. For example, if a \nmaximum limit of one parking space for every 2,500 square feet of site area is applied \nto an 8,000 square foot site, the resulting fraction of 3.2 is rounded down to 3 allowed \nparking spaces. \n2. Density. Maximum density calculations are rounded as follows. For the purposes of \nthis measurement, rounding is based on a fraction that is truncated to two numbers \npast the decimal point. For example, 1.7398 is truncated to 1.73. \na. 1.01 to 3.99. Where a maximum density calculation results in number that is at \nleast 1.01 and up to 3.99: \n(1) If the fraction is less than .90, the fraction is rounded down to the next \nwhole number. For example, if a maximum limit of one dwelling unit for \nevery 5,000 square feet of site area is applied to a 13,900 square foot site, \nthe resulting fraction of 2.78 is rounded down to 2 allowed dwelling units.  \n(2) If the fraction is .90 or above, the fraction is rounded up to the next whole \nnumber. For example, if a maximum limit of one dwelling unit for every \n5,000 square feet of site area is applied to a 14,600 square foot site, the \nresulting fraction of 2.92 is rounded up to 3 allowed dwelling units. \nb. 4.01 to 10.99. Where a maximum density calculation results in a number that is \nat least 4.01 and up to 10.99: \n(1) If the fraction is less than .75, the fraction is rounded down to the next \nwhole number. For example, if a maximum limit of one dwelling unit for \nevery 5,000 square feet of site area is applied to a 23,400 square foot site, \nthe resulting fraction of 4.68 is rounded down to 4 allowed dwelling units.  \n(2) If the fraction is .75 or larger, the fraction is rounded up to the next whole \nnumber. For example, If a maximum limit of one dwelling unit for every \n5,000 square feet of site area is applied to a 23,900 square foot site, the \nresulting fraction of 4.78 is rounded up to 5 allowed dwelling units. \nc. 11.01 or larger. Where a maximum density calculation results in a number that is \n11.01 or greater: \n(1) If the fraction is less than .50, the fraction is rounded down to the next \nwhole number. For example, if a maximum limit of one dwelling unit for \nevery 5,000 square feet of site area is applied to a 56,200 square foot site, \nthe resulting fraction of 11.24 is rounded down to 11 allowed  \ndwelling units.  \n(2) If the fraction is .50 or larger, the fraction is rounded up to the next whole \nnumber. For example, If a maximum limit of one dwelling unit for every \n5,000 square feet of site area is applied to a 58,200 square foot site, the \nresulting fraction of 11.64 is rounded up to 12 allowed dwelling units.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.930 \n8/1/21 Measurements \n \n930-3 \n33.930.025 Measuring Development Standards  \nUnless otherwise stated below or elsewhere in this Title, all measurements involving development \nstandards are based on the property lines and area of the site after dedication of public rights-of-\nway and/or designation of private rights-of-way. Standards include, but are not limited to, building \ncoverage, floor area ratio, setbacks, and landscaping requirements. When site area is being \ndedicated for public right-of-way, calculation of floor area ratio is based on the site area at the time \nof building permit application. \n33.930.030 Measuring Distances \nA. Distances are measured horizontally. When determining distances for setbacks and \nstructure dimensions, all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the \nappropriate property line, edge of building, structure, storage area, parking area, or other \nobject. These distances are not measured by following the topography of the land. See \nFigure 930-1. \nFigure 930-1 \nHorizontal Measurement \n \nB. Measurements are shortest distance. When measuring a required distance, such as the \nminimum distance between a structure and a lot line, the measurement is made at the \nshortest distance between the two objects. See Figure 930-2.

Measurements of vehicle travel areas. Measurement of a minimum travel distance for \nvehicles, such as garage entrance setbacks and stacking lane distances, are measured down \nthe center of the vehicle travel area. For example, curving driveways and travel lanes are \nmeasured along the arc of the driveway or traffic lane. See Figure 930-3. \nD. Measurement of distance between rights-of-way. Distance between rights-of-way is \nmeasured from centerline of one right-of-way to the centerline of the other right-of-way. \nFigure 930-3 \nMeasuring Vehicle Travel Areas \n \n \nE. Measurements involving a structure. Measurements involving a structure are made to the \nclosest wall of the structure. Chimneys, eaves, building and window trim, and bay windows \nup to 12 feet in length, are not included in the measurement. Other items, such as covered \nporches and entrances, are included in the measurement. See Figure 930-2 above, and the \nbase zone chapters.

Measurements of the dimensions of a landscaped area include only the area \nthat is actually landscaped, and not any other elements, such as protective curbs. \nH. Measurement of distance from a bus stop or Transit Station. When measuring distance \nfrom a bus stop, the measurement is taken from the bus stop sign. When measuring \ndistance from a Transit Station, the measurement is taken from the edge of the platform. \n33.930.040 Measuring Distances on Maps \nZone boundaries that are shown crossing lots are usually based on a topographic feature or a set \nmeasurement from a property line or topographic feature, such as the top of slope, middle of \nstream, 25 feet from top of bank, or 30 feet from property line. When zone boundaries are shown \ncrossing properties with no clear indication of the basis for the line, exact distances are to be \ndetermined by scaling the distances from the Official Zoning Maps, using the center of the  \nzoning line. \n33.930.050 Measuring Height \nA. Measuring building height. The height of a building is the vertical distance between the \nbase reference point and the highest roof-type reference point. The methods for \nestablishing the base reference point are described in Paragraph A.1. Methods to establish \nthe roof-type reference point are described in Paragraph A.2.  \n1. Base reference point. \na. In commercial/mixed use and multi-dwelling zones. In the commercial/mixed-use \nzones, when any portion of a building is within 25 feet of an existing or proposed \nsidewalk, the base reference point is determined using the method described in \nSubsubparagraphs A.1.a(1) and A.1.a(2). See Figure 930-25 and 930-26. If no  Chapter 33.930 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMeasurements 8/1/21 \n \n930-6 \nportion of a building is within 25 feet of an existing or proposed sidewalk, the \nbase reference point is determined using the method described in Subparagraph \nA.1.b. In addition, in the multi-dwelling zones, when the structure is a multi-\ndwelling structure, and some portion of the building is within 25 feet of an \nexisting or proposed sidewalk, the applicant may choose to use the following \nmethod for determining base reference point: \n(1) Identify the lowest and highest grade of the sidewalk located within 25 feet \nof the building.  \n(2) Determine the base reference point: \n• When the lowest grade of the existing or proposed sidewalk located \nwithin 25 feet of the building is not more than 10 feet below the highest \ngrade of the sidewalk adjacent to the site within 25 feet of the building, \nthe base reference point is the highest grade of the sidewalk.  \n• When the lowest grade of the existing or proposed sidewalk located \nwithin 25 feet of the building is more than 10 feet below the highest \ngrade of the sidewalk adjacent to the site within 25 feet of the building, \nthe base reference point is the lowest grade of the sidewalk plus 10 \nfeet. \nb. In all other situations, the base reference point is determined using the method \ndescribed in Subparagraphs A.1.b(1) and A.1.b(2). See Figure 930-6:  \n(1) Identify the lowest and highest grade exactly 5 feet from the building. To \nestablish lowest and highest grade, draw a line exactly 5 feet from all sides \nof the building and identify the lowest and the highest grade along the line. \nExclude from the identification of lowest grade pedestrian-only paths that \nare no more than 5 feet wide that provide access from the street to an \nentrance into the building. If the property line is less than 5 feet from any \nside of the building, the line must follow the property line for the segment \nwhere the property line is less than 5 feet from the building.   \n(2) Determine the base reference point: \n• When the lowest grade is not more than 10 feet below the highest \ngrade exactly 5 feet from the building, the lowest grade is the base \nreference point.  \n• When the lowest grade is more than 10 feet below the highest grade \nexactly 5 feet from the building, the base reference point is the lowest \ngrade plus 10 feet. \n2. Roof-type reference point. The methods to determine the roof-type reference point \nare described below and are shown in Figure 930-5. There may be multiple roof-type \nreference points on a building: \na. Flat roof (pitch is 2 in 12 or less): Measure to the highest point of the roof except \nin the single-dwelling zones where the measurement is to the top of the parapet, \nor if there is no parapet, to the highest point of the roof. \nb. Mansard roof: Measure to the deck line.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.930 \n8/1/21 Measurements \n \n930-7 \nc. Gabled, hipped, gambrel, or pyramidal roof: Measure to the average height of \nthe gable. \nd. Other roof types such as domed, shed, or vaulted shapes: Measure to the highest \npoint. \ne. Stepped or terraced building: Measure to the highest point of any segment of the \nbuilding. \nFigure 930-5 \nMeasuring Height – Roof Types \n \n \n \n \nFigure 930-6                                                   \nMeasuring Height – Determining Base Reference Point  \n \n \n  Chapter 33.930 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMeasurements 8/1/21 \n \n930-8 \n \nFigure 930-25 \nMeasuring Height – Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \nFigure 930-26 \nMeasuring Height – Sidewalk Area Used for Height Measurement  \nin Commercial/Mixed Use Zones \n \n \nB. Measuring height of other structures. The height of other structures such as flag poles and \nfences is the vertical distance from the ground level immediately under the structure to the \ntop of a structure, excluding exempted portions. When chimneys and other objects are \nallowed to exceed the base height of the zone by a set amount, that set amount is \nmeasured to the top of these objects. Special measurement provisions are also  \nprovided below.  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.930 \n8/1/21 Measurements \n \n930-9 \n1. Measuring height of retaining walls and fences. Retaining walls and fences on top of \nretaining walls are measured from the ground level on the higher side of the retaining \nwall. See Figure 930-8. \nFigure 930-8 \nMeasuring Height – Retaining Walls \n \n \n2. Measuring height of decks. Deck height is determined by measuring from the ground \nto the top of the floor of the deck if there is no rail or if the rail walls are more than 50 \npercent open, and from the ground to the top of the rails for all other situations. \n33.930.055 Measuring the Area of Limited Uses \nThe extent of allowed area for a use that is limited in size is determined by adding the square \nfootage that the use occupies including exterior eating areas.  \nArea devoted to mechanical equipment, elevators, and stairwells are not included.  \nIn multi-tenant buildings common areas, such as lobbies, bathrooms and hallways are not included \nwhen other permitted primary uses that are not limited uses occupy the building.  \nRegulations in the base zone, overlay zone or plan district may specify additional area that is either \nincluded or excluded from the total area, such as parking area, exterior storage, or exterior display. \n33.930.060 Determining Average Slope \nWhen calculating the slope of a lot an average slope is used based on the elevations at the corners \nof the lot. The average slope of a lot is calculated by subtracting the average elevation of the uphill \nlot line and the average elevation of the downhill lot line and dividing the sum by the average \ndistance between the two lot lines. The average elevation of the uphill or downhill lot line is \ncalculated by adding the elevations at the ends of the lot line and dividing by two. See Figure 930-9.  Chapter 33.930 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMeasurements 8/1/21 \n \n930-10 \n33.930.070 Determining the Area of the Facade of a Building \nThe area of a specific facade of a building is determined by adding the square footage of surface \narea of each section of wall visible from that perspective. For buildings with more than one wall \nalong one facade (for example, rooms jutting out from the main building or a building where each \nfloor is set back from the floor below), all of the walls are included in the total area. The total area \ndoes not include any roof area. See Figure 930-10. \nFigure 930-9 \nCalculating Average Slope \n \n \nFigure 930-10 \nFacade of a Building \n \n \n33.930.080 Determining the Plane of a Building Wall \nThe purpose of this measurement system is to provide a way to calculate varying amounts of bulk \non a particular side of a structure. The plane of a building wall is a plane that extends from the \nground to the top of each wall of a structure. A structure with more than one wall along one facade  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.930 \n10/1/24 Measurements \n \n930-11 \n(for example, rooms jutting out from the main structure or a structure where each floor is set back \nfrom the floor below) will have a different plane for each of the walls. The area of the plane is \ndetermined by calculating the area of the plane from the ground to the top of the wall. The plane \ndoes not include roof area. \nIn situations where there is more than one wall along one facade, the bulk of the closer walls covers \nthe bulk of walls that are farther back. In these situations, the wall is measured by extending the \nplane of the wall to the area that is behind a closer wall. See Figure 930-11. [There are special \nmeasurement rules for situations where the plane of the building wall is wider than portions of the \nwall below. See Figure 930-12, below.] \nFigure 930-11 \nPlane of a Building Wall \n \n \nWhere the plane of a building wall contains portions that are wider than areas of the wall that are \nbelow it, the calculation of area is made using the wider dimension and extending the plane to the \nopen area below. See Figure 930-12. \nFigure 930-12 \nAdditions to the Plane of a Building Wall \n  \n \n33.930.090 Determining the Garage Wall Area \nThe garage wall area is determined by calculating the area of the specific side of a structure that is \nbacked by garage space. The garage wall area is not limited to the area of the garage door; it \nincludes all the area on the specified side of a structure between the ceiling, floor, and walls of the \ngarage (see Figure 930-13). For carports, the garage wall area is determined by calculating the area \nof a vertical plane extending from the outer edges of the roof to the nearest grade. The area within \na gable is not included in the calculation. See Figure 930-14.  Chapter 33.930 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMeasurements 10/1/24 \n \n930-12 \n33.930.100 Measuring Lot Widths  \nA. Single-Dwelling zones. In the single-dwelling zones, lot width is measured by placing a \nrectangle along the minimum front building setback line. Where the setback line is curved, \nthe rectangle is placed on the line between the intersection points of the setback line with \nthe side lot lines. See Figure 930-20. \n \nThe rectangle must have a minimum width equal to the minimum lot width specified for \nthe zone in Chapter 33.610. The rectangle must have a minimum depth of 40 feet, or \nextend to the rear property line, whichever is less. The rectangle must fit entirely within \nthe lot. See Figure 930-20.  \nB. All other zones. In all other zones, lot widths are measured from the midpoints of opposite \nlot lines. See Figure 930-15. \nFigure 930-13 \nGarage Wall Area \n \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.930 \n10/1/24 Measurements \n \n930-13 \nFigure 930-14 \nGarage Wall Area (Carport) \n \nFigure 930-20 \nMeasuring Lot Width in Single-Dwelling Zones \n \n \n33.930.103 Measuring Lot Depths \nLot depths are measured from the midpoints of opposite lot lines. See Figure 930-16.  Chapter 33.930 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMeasurements 10/1/24 \n \n930-14 \nFigure 930-15                               Figure 930-16 \nMeasuring Lot Width                     Measuring Lot Depth \n \n \n \n33.930.110 Measuring Areas with Squares of Specified Dimensions \nRequired areas (for example, required usable outdoor areas in residential zones and the industrial \nzone lot standards) must be of a sufficient size and configuration so that a square measuring X by X \ncan be placed totally within the required area. The dimensions of the square are stated in the base \nzone chapters. See Figure 930-17. \nFigure 930-17 \nUsing Squares With Specified Dimensions \n \n33.930.120 Setback Averaging \nCertain regulations allow for setbacks to be averaged. In these situations the required setback may \nbe reduced to the average of the existing setbacks of the lots that are on both sides of the site. See \nFigure 930-18. The following rules apply in calculating the average:  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.930 \n10/1/24 Measurements \n \n930-15 \nA. The setbacks used for the calculations must be for the same type of structure that is being \naveraged. For example, only garage entrance setbacks may be used to average a garage \nentrance setback, and only deck setbacks may be used to average a deck setback. \nB. Only the setbacks on the lots that abut each side of the site and are on the same street may \nbe used. Setbacks across the street or along a different street may not be used. \nC. When one abutting lot is vacant or if the lot is a corner lot, then the average is of the \nsetback of the nonvacant lot and the required setback for the zone. \nFigure 930-18 \nSetback Averaging \n \n33.930.130 Measuring Tree Diameter \nTree diameter is measured in several ways: \nA. Existing trees.  \n1. Existing trees are generally measured in terms of diameter inches at a height of 4-1/2 \nfeet above the ground. The diameter may be determined by measuring the \ncircumference of the tree trunk and dividing by 3.14. See Figure 930-19.  Chapter 33.930 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMeasurements 10/1/24 \n \n930-16 \nFigure 930-19  \nMeasuring Tree Size for Existing Trees \n \n \n2. When the trunk is at an angle or is on a slope, the trunk is measured at right angles to \nthe trunk 4-1/2 feet along the center of the trunk axis, so the height is the average of \nthe shortest and the longest sides of the trunk. See Figure 930-21. \nFigure 930-21  \nMeasuring Existing Trees with an Angle or on Slopes \n \n3. When the trunk branches or splits less than 4-1/2 feet from the ground, the trunk is \nmeasured at the smallest circumference below the lowest branch. See Figure 930-22. \nFigure 930-22  \nMeasuring Split Trunk Tree \n  Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.930 \n10/1/24 Measurements \n \n930-17 \n4. For multi-stemmed trees, the size is determined by measuring all the trunks and \nadding the total diameter of the largest trunk and one-half the diameter of each \nadditional trunk; see Figure 930-23. A multi-stemmed tree has trunks that are \nconnected above the ground and does not include individual trees growing close \ntogether or from a common root stock that do not have trunks connected above  \nthe ground.  \nFigure 930-23 \nMeasuring Multi-stemmed Trees \n \nB. New trees. New trees are measured in caliper inch, which is the diameter of the trunk 6 \ninches above the ground or root ball. For coniferous trees, the tree height may also  \nbe used. \n33.930.140 Measuring the Root Protection Zone \nThe root protection zone is a circular area around a tree that is based on the diameter of the tree. \nEach 1 inch diameter of tree equals 1 foot radius for the root protection zone. See Figure 930-24. \nFigure 930-24 \nMeasuring the Root Protection Zone \n  Chapter 33.930 Title 33, Planning and Zoning \nMeasurements 10/1/24 \n \n930-18 \n33.930.150 Measuring Top of Bank  \nSee Section 33.910.030, Environmental-Related Definitions, Top of Bank \nA. Using Percent Slope. Percent slope is determined by dividing the vertical rise by the \nhorizontal run, and converting that decimal to a percentage. For example, a slope section \nthat rises 1 foot over a distance of 4 feet is a 25 percent slope. \nB. Identifying a Decrease in Slope. A decrease in slope is a change in percent slope from a \nsteeper to a less steep grade. For example, a change from 40 percent slope to 30 percent \nslope is a decrease in slope of 10 percent. A change from 35 percent slope to 15 percent \nslope is a decrease in slope of 20 percent. To identify the decrease in slope the slope must \nbe sampled every 3 feet between the ordinary high water mark and a point 50 feet from \nthe ordinary high water mark. See Figure 930-27. \nFigure 930-27a \nExample 1: Identifying a Decrease in Slope \n \nFigure 930-27b \nExample 2: Identifying a Decrease in Slope \n \nC. Relationship to Other Structures. See Figure 930-28. \n1. Where a structure straddles the top of bank, the top of bank line is drawn as a straight \nline through the structure, connecting the top of bank line on either side.  \n2. Where there is a vertical bulkhead or seawall, the top of bank is the point at the top of \nthe bulkhead that is closest to the river.   Title 33, Planning and Zoning Chapter 33.930 \n10/1/24 Measurements \n \n930-19 \n3. Docks, pilings, slips, wharves and other similar structures built over the water are not \nfactored into the determination of top of bank.  Where there is a dock, wharf or other \nstructure on the bank, measurements of slope are taken on the underlying dry land.   \n4. Where the bank itself is a structure, such as a rip-rap slope at the edge of reclaimed \nland, the top of bank line is based on the predominant slope of that structure, rather \nthan the slope of individual boulders or structural elements.   \nFigure 930-28 \nTop of Bank in Relation to Other Structures \n \nD. Default Top of Bank. If no slope decrease of 10 percent or more is found within 50 feet \n(measured horizontally) of the ordinary high water mark, then the top of bank will be one \nof the following default locations, see Figure 930-29. The Willamette River Reaches are \nshown on Map 440-1 and 475-1: \n1. For the Willamette River Central Reach and Willamette River South Reach, the default \ntop of bank is 50 feet (measured horizontally) from the ordinary high water mark.   \n2. For the Willamette River North Reach and the Columbia River, the default top of bank \nis 2 feet (measured vertically) from the ordinary high water mark. \n3. For perennial streams, seeps and wetlands the default top of bank is 15 feet \n(measured horizontally) from the ordinary high water mark. \n4. For intermittent and ephemeral streams, the default top of bank is 15 feet (measured \nhorizontally) from the centerline of the stream.
